Fashion & Style,"On This Runway, Non-Models and Cool Kids",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/fashion/eckhaus-latta-casting-new-york-fashion-week.html,"Over Labor Day weekend, a steady stream of hopefuls arrived at Eckhaus Latta's basement studio in Chinatown for the chance to take an audition strut down a makeshift runway.

New York Fashion Week was days away, and Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta, the designers of Eckhaus Latta, and their casting director, Rachel Chandler, were surveying the talent (male, female and nonconforming) hoping to appear in their fashion show on Sept. 10.

Eckhaus Latta is an anomaly among the trendy sportswear labels that otherwise populate New York Fashion Week. Mr. Eckhaus and Ms. Latta, both 28, founded it in 2011, straight out of the Rhode Island School of Design, where neither had studied fashion (he, sculpture; she, textiles). And it maintains an air of art school (there is much talk of various ""creative practices"" and their ""process-oriented"" praxis).

Their designs have been exhibited at the hipper museums of the coasts -- at MoMA PS1, in New York, and the Hammer Museum, in Los Angeles -- and their shows often have the flavor of an old-school ""happening."" (Their last show was held at PS1, at 9:30 p.m., on a weekday night mid-fashion week, in a snowstorm. Hundreds turned up anyway.)",How the Eckhaus Latta designers select fashion week's coolest cast.,e9cd6477-5eb6-58b2-8e33-fd2d881bf656,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/10/fashion/10ECKHAUS-WEB1/10ECKHAUS-WEB1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=650df93b3e54b1d21163675e9fbff3d34391b30c94d95df3894a16482eec6e6d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mike Eckhaus, center right, and Zoe Latta, center left, of the fashion label Eckhaus Latta.",e9cd6477-5eb6-58b2-8e33-fd2d881bf656,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/e9cd6477-5eb6-58b2-8e33-fd2d881bf656.jpg,19
Theater,"The New 42nd Street, a Theater Nonprofit, Names Its Next Leader",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/theater/new-42nd-street-russell-granet.html,"The New 42nd Street -- the nonprofit organization behind the New Victory Theater, the New 42nd Street Studios and the Duke on 42nd Street -- has named Russell Granet as its new president and chief executive officer.

Until May, Mr. Granet was the acting president of Lincoln Center, where he had run the education and community engagement division and served in other leadership roles. He will start at the New 42nd Street in July. ""I couldn't imagine a better position or a better place to work,"" Mr. Granet said in an interview .

Mr. Granet will follow on the heels of the organization's longtime leader Cora Cahan, who is stepping down after about 29 years. Under her tenure, in the 1990s, the organization spearheaded the restoration of seven historic theaters on 42nd Street and helped to transform the street into a cultural hub . The New 42nd Street also opened three spaces in the area: the family theater the New Victory, which offers shows for children at prices sometimes as low as $2; the New 42nd Street Studios, which gives emerging artists a much-sought-after rehearsal site to create new work; and the Duke, a black-box theater available for rental.

Mr. Granet said that as leader of the New 42nd Street, he'll focus on commissioning new work. He said he will prioritize offering the New 42nd Street Studios as an incubator space for projects by emerging artists and using the Duke to stage those works.","Russell Granet will be the new president and chief executive of the organization, taking over as Cora Cahan steps down.",acdcd1ef-71a9-55f2-9993-7a231d57396f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/11/arts/11new42-item/11new42-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=51f9691b9923b0bc48ba24502080cef57ea96e060732b95f66a0814323950174&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The New 42nd Street board chairwoman, Fiona Rudin, with Russell Granet.",acdcd1ef-71a9-55f2-9993-7a231d57396f,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/acdcd1ef-71a9-55f2-9993-7a231d57396f.jpg,10
Economy,Tax Tactics Threaten Public Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/business/economy/multinational-tax-strategies-put-public-coffers-at-risk.html,"When the European Commission charged this week that Ireland's sweetheart tax treatment of Apple amounted to an illegal corporate subsidy, the company said that it had done nothing wrong. Apple executives might have added that whatever they did, they were not alone. Corporate tax strategies intended to minimize global taxes, by hook or by crook, are by now standard practice. Google and Facebook move money through Ireland to lower their taxes. Starbucks uses the Netherlands, a practice that is under review by Europe as well. ""The commission picked up a case which is quite common in terms of tax planning,"" said Pascal Saint-Amans, who runs the Center for Tax Policy and Administration at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the policy advisory organization of the world's advanced nations. The question is whether this sort of strategy -- as common to multinational companies as filing a tax return every year -- can truly be stopped. What hangs in the balance is whether governments can continue to tax corporations beyond the barest minimum. Or whether globalization will make such taxation all but impossible.

""A combination of greater economic integration and more income accruing to intangibles like intellectual property, which by nature are hard to locate, does raise profound questions for the future of taxation,"" said Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and President Obama's first chief economic policy adviser. ""It is a significant problem for the revenue capacity of states and an immense problem for their capacity to maintain progressive taxation."" If corporations can continue to evade taxation -- using strategies like sham transactions between phantom subsidiaries to shift profits to the lowest tax jurisdictions and costs to where taxes are highest -- the burden of public finance will land almost entirely on the shoulders of ordinary workers, the only link in the economic chain that can't move. ""Consider a superstar banker, an enormously valuable pharmaceutical patent, a terrific entertainer, an assembly line worker and a teacher. Of all those things, which is the least mobile?"" asked Mr. Summers. ""A tax system that can't reach the mobile is a tax system that is going to burden working people."" Some scholars -- including Robert B. Reich, who served as Labor Secretary during the Clinton administration and now teaches at the University of California, Berkeley; and Greg Mankiw of Harvard, who was former chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush -- have proposed abolishing the corporate income tax, replacing it with direct taxes on shareholders. But it is highly doubtful that the American political system could raise taxes on dividends, capital gains and upper incomes enough to compensate for the lost revenue from business. Rich taxpayers also have their own sophisticated tools to shield income, including parking money in tax havens around the world.

Mr. Saint-Amans said he feared that without the corporate income tax, income taxation would fall apart entirely as the wealthy could avoid taxation by becoming companies, inserting several corporate layers between themselves and their money. Nobody has a confident grasp of the scale of corporate tax avoidance. Corporate tax revenue in the United States today amounts to some 2.6 percent of total economic activity, roughly the same as it did in the early 1980s, when the latest wave of globalization took off. Across the 34 O.E.C.D. nations, corporate tax revenue actually grew from just above 2 percent of G.D.P. in the 1960s to some 3.7 percent in 2007, before the financial crisis walloped companies around the world. These figures can be misleading, though. In the United States, corporate taxes have remained flat despite a sharp increase in corporate profits, which today take the highest share of national income since the government started measuring them in the 1920s. Profits have similarly risen in other industrial countries around the world. Plus, there is plenty of suggestive evidence that profit-shifting has become a core pillar of corporate strategy.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. In 2012 the Irish subsidiaries of American multinationals generated $120 billion in profit, according to United States government data, eight times as much as their German subsidiaries. Subsidiaries in Bermuda generated $82 billion, four times as much as subsidiaries in Mexico.

Americans seem to be the most nimble dodgers. The United States has a higher statutory corporate tax rate than Europe, but according to a recent study by Reuven S. Avi-Yonah of the University of Michigan Law School and Yaron Lahav of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, European multinationals effectively pay a higher rate than their American counterparts. The problem is global. In 2010, according to the International Monetary Fund, Barbados, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands received more foreign direct investment combined than Germany or Japan. The British Virgin Islands was the second-largest investor in China, after Hong Kong. These fictions are possible because most of the money flows through shell corporations that employ nobody and produce nothing. Can these problems be fixed? ""I think so,"" Mr. Saint-Amans said. ""The golden age of 'We plan aggressively and pay taxes nowhere' is over."" The European Commission's deployment of competition policy to go after dubious tax breaks in Apple's case is a novel and potentially powerful strategy, which could be applied to many other arrangements. Governments in both the rich and poor world are fed up, Mr. Saint-Amans said. Having spent the last few decades drafting rules to prevent double taxation, they are now terrified that they have built a system of double nontaxation instead. Governments that turned a blind eye to the tax avoidance of their multinational champions to give them a competitive edge against foreign rivals are now under enormous pressure from voters to prove that it's not only workers and dupes paying taxes.

The O.E.C.D., Mr. Saint-Amans says, has no business telling countries what tax rate they should impose. If the Irish can fund their government charging companies 12.5 percent, that's their business. Still, he trusts new rules developed by the O.E.C.D., if broadly adopted, could put an end to common avoidance practices, like parking valuable intellectual property in tax havens or having subsidiaries in high-tax jurisdictions, where interest is deductible, borrow from subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions where interest is not taxable. Under enormous pressure from the rest of the world, tax havens might even repent. The Irish, he said, have been mulling tightening the rules unilaterally, concluding that the bad blood generated by the arrangements outweighs the modest number of jobs that they lure and the scant tax revenue that these artificial investments leave in the country. There are reasons, however, to remain cautious that the world's tax collectors can get ahead of its corporate tax strategists. The trend in the United States, if anything, is going in the opposite direction. Despite the Obama administration's new rules to prevent so-called corporate inversions, where companies move their tax residency abroad, companies like Burger King and Medtronic are still dropping their American ""citizenship"" to reduce their tax liability. Ireland has based its entire development strategy on becoming a low tax base for the multinationals of the world. And until the financial crisis walloped its banks, it had been successful. As Mr. Summers pointed out, putting a stop to the shell company shenanigans doesn't automatically put an end to international tax competition. In fact, it might make it worse.","If global corporations can continue to evade taxation, the burden of government financing could fall disproportionately on ordinary workers.",1de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/29/business/eduardo-porter/eduardo-porter-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=900&w=600&s=e0f5bc829638945c9b9699e41305b013e6fb17053b1c05c78d9b02c6891b47ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Eduardo Porter,1de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/1de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c.jpg,8
Television,Review: 'The Chi' Returns to the South Side of Chicago,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/television/the-chi-review-season-2.html,"""The Chi"" was built around a series of shootings, and the way their repercussions rippled out through the lives of its large cast. But its best material was casual and observational. The testy relationships of the aspiring chef Brandon (Jason Mitchell) with his live-in girlfriend, Jerrika (Tiffany Boone), and his entrepreneurial frenemy Hannibal (Chris Lee) felt fresh. Even more original and entertaining were the story lines involving the middle schoolers Kevin (Alex Hibbert), Papa (Shamon Brown Jr.) and Maisha (Genesis Denise Hale), whose hilariously passive-aggressive pursuit of the mild-mannered Kevin was the show's single best idea.

That first season can be streamed on Showtime's website or through Amazon Prime Video. It's necessary if you're going to understand what's going on in Season 2, and maybe it's sufficient. Because through five episodes of the new season, a lot of the shine is gone from ""The Chi."" The story lines are largely continuous: the fallout from the killing of Brandon's younger brother by the tortured Ronnie (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine); the strife between the player Emmett (Jacob Latimore) and Tiffany (Hannaha Hall), the mother of his child; Brandon's constantly stymied efforts to get his food-truck business off the ground.

But the urgency has faded from them, partly because of a sense that the bones of Season 1 are being gnawed over for too long, but mostly because the show's sensitivity and unpredictability are, at almost every moment, shading over into conventional melodrama and self-conscious point making. As characters make speeches about fatherhood and police corruption, and we sit through stiff, sentimental flashbacks to Ronnie's stressful return from military duty in the Middle East, the show starts to feel like an earlier Showtime drama set in Chicago, the buppie soap opera ""Soul Food.""

The middle schoolers are still used for comic relief -- selling candy bars to parishioners as they break a fast, engaging in a food fight on school picture day -- but the situations have more of a tinny sitcom quality, and the young actors' performances are correspondingly less joyful. (Hale still makes the most of every minute onscreen, though.) Mitchell and Latimore feel stuck, too, with Brandon's and Emmett's stories taking on a flattened, didactic tone they didn't have in Season 1. The major new twist to the plot, a mystery element apparently involving gentrification, is playing out slowly but already feels forced into what's been a distinctively organic narrative.

The cast turnover between seasons was small, though Sonja Sohn, as Brandon's hard-edge mother, and Steven Williams, as an old-school gangbanger, are missed. The one big change was the replacement of the showrunner Elwood Reid by Ayanna Floyd Davis. Their producing and writing credits aren't dissimilar -- ""The Bridge"" and ""Cold Case"" for Reid, ""Empire"" and ""Hannibal"" for Davis -- and it's never a good idea to place too much credit or blame on one person in the ecosystem of a TV series. But chemistry matters, and in Season 2 the formula's off.",Lena Waithe's neighborhood drama on Showtime didn't get the awards-season attention it deserved for Season 1.

Opinion,Banks Should Face History and Pay Reparations,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/opinion/sunday/banks-reparations-racism-inequality.html,"Ms. Blackwell is founder in residence at PolicyLink, a research and advocacy institute, where Mr. McAfee is the chief executive.





Corporate chief executives have been tripping over themselves to demonstrate their support for racial justice. They've taken a knee, tweeted that black lives matter, donated money to advocacy groups and affirmed their commitment to inclusion. That's all well and good. And following through on their promises -- by hiring and promoting more people of color, diversifying boards and executive suites and paying all workers decent wages and essential benefits -- would be even better. But business leaders who are serious about fighting racism will hold themselves accountable for the bitter inequities they have helped to create and sustain, and from which they have profited. Every industry must now use its power to repair the damage and heal the wounds. The financial industry is a good place to start. Banks have been underwriters of American racism -- no industry has played a bigger or more enduring role in black oppression, exploitation and exclusion. Banks financed the slave trade and in some cases ""repossessed"" humans in bondage.

White-owned banks refused to serve black people who left the South escaping brutality and seeking opportunity during the Great Migration of the early and mid-20th century. Bank policies and practices contributed to segregating every major city and denying black families the two most important toeholds to the middle class -- ownership of homes and of businesses. Federal legislation beginning in the 1960s prohibited the most blatant discrimination in banking and lending. It banned redlining, the practice named for the color-coded maps that lenders used to deny mortgages in black neighborhoods. But banks and real estate agents found ways to exploit the desire of black people to own homes, leaving many in foreclosure. Racial disparities in access to the conventional mortgage market endured, leaving black home buyers vulnerable to fraud and risky loans, as the subprime mortgage fiasco exposed so painfully.

Similarly, banks deny loans to black-owned businesses at twice the rate of white-owned ones. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for small black companies to grow. But the industry doesn't only suppress black wealth, it aggressively strips it, through excessive interest rates on consumer debt, egregious overdraft penalties and higher fees even for simple A.T.M. transactions. It's no surprise that the median black family had roughly one-tenth of the wealth of a white family as of 2016. The gap not only limits education and career options, it's also a source of gnawing anxiety about how the bills will get paid in the event of a job loss or costly illness -- setbacks facing millions of families, again disproportionately black, during the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, the wealth gap hurts the nation's economy. McKinsey & Company calculates that closing the black-white wealth gap could increase G.D.P. by 4 percent to 6 percent, or more than $1 trillion, by 2028. A federal reparations policy is unlikely to come anytime soon. But banks and financial institutions don't have to wait. First, they must apologize for their culpability for and complicity in structural racism. Next, they must commit to serving black people as they do whites. Then, with these four bold policies, the industry can start to close the wealth gap, repair the harms and serve as a model for a nation struggling to reckon with racism: Americans carry a lot of consumer debt, but as Christian Weller reports in Forbes, nobody bears a heavier burden than African-American families. They are the only racial group that owes more than their belongings are worth -- they could sell all their possessions and they would still be in debt. More from ""The America We Need"" Black families on average had $8,554 in consumer debt in September 2019. And they pay more for debt -- about $735 a year in interest on every $10,000 they borrow, compared with $514 for white families. Because they have less access to conventional banks and the mortgage market, many black families are forced to rely on high-interest alternatives such as payday loans. Additionally, black people are hit with higher bank fines and harsher punishment, including wage garnishment, for loan defaults, making it harder to climb out of debt. Freeing families from the drag of this debt would help them build savings and obtain financial security. Nearly half of black households have limited access to retail banking services or none at all. And black customers who have bank accounts pay more -- $190 more for a checking account -- compared with white customers, according to one study.

That's because banks in communities of color generally require higher opening balances and minimums to avoid fees, and they charge more for A.T.M. transactions and overdrafts. Seemingly small differences in bank fees pay off handsomely for the industry. Of the more than $11 billion that big banks collected last year in overdraft-related fees, the bulk came from just 9 percent of account holders -- consumers who generally have low bank balances, according to a study by the Center for Responsible Lending. Ending these egregious practices would make banking more attractive to black consumers. The long history of blatant racism in mortgage lending is well known. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was supposed to end it. But today, the rate of black homeownership, 43 percent, is barely higher than when that law took effect -- and much lower than white homeownership, at 70 percent. Given the persistent racism in the mortgage market and the subprime mortgage disaster, which not only resulted in homeownership disparities but also limited the value of homes owned by black people, banks must provide interest-free mortgages to black home buyers. These loans could be capped at the regional median loan value and should be in place until black homeownership is on par with white homeownership. Expanding secure homeownership for black families and creating opportunities for them to buy in markets where real estate enjoys healthy increases in value will improve economic mobility and begin to create generational wealth. Black Americans, women especially, start small businesses at higher rates than whites. From 2007 to 2012, the number of black-owned businesses increased nearly 35 percent. But almost all are sole proprietorships or partnerships with no employees, in no small part because they lack access to capital. More than half of black-owned companies are turned down for bank loans, twice the rate of white business owners. Black businesses need investment to grow, especially during the pandemic, yet baked-in racism in the Paycheck Protection Program meant that only 12 percent of black and Latino business owners received the loans they requested.",The financial industry can close the wealth gap and serve as a model for a nation struggling to reckon with racism.,165426ae-1e7c-5193-8596-ef96357645a8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/opinion/25ineqWeb/25ineqWeb-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=23b7a6e66e1a2857c85eaee40bf5bf01dfa47a466f49edfac62a5498c3932a79&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Wells Fargo bank in Minneapolis was set on fire during protests against the death of George Floyd.

Books,"Mercedes Barcha, Gabriel García Márquez's Wife and Muse, Dies at 87",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/books/mercedes-barcha-dead.html,"Mercedes Barcha and her husband, the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in 2007. ""Mercedes permeates all my books,"" Garcia Marquez once said. ""There's traces of her everywhere.""





Mercedes Barcha, the widow, muse and gatekeeper of the Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who played a crucial role in the publication of his breakthrough novel, ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" died on Aug. 15 at her home in Mexico City. She was 87. Her death was confirmed by her son Rodrigo Garcia, who said she had suffered from respiratory problems for many years. Mercedes and Gabo, as the couple were known, were living in Mexico City in 1965 when Garcia Marquez began work on ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" the hypnotic, time-bending tale of the mythical village of Macondo, based on the area of Colombia where they had both grown up. For more than a decade, Garcia Marquez had been eking out a living as a journalist -- a passionate leftist, he spent a year in the New York office of Prensa Latina, the Cuban press agency -- while banging out short stories and novellas. For 18 months, he had holed up in his office in their home while Ms. Barcha kept the landlord, and the world, at bay. When he emerged in late 1966, he later recalled, she asked: ""Did you really finish it? We owe $12,000.""

She then pawned her hair dryer and the couple's blender so she could pay the postage to send the manuscript to his Argentine editor. The book -- a South American Genesis, as many would call it, or ""an intricate stew of truths and mirages,"" as Garcia Marquez wrote, in which priests levitated and flowers rained from the sky -- would go on to sell nearly 50 million copies. ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" and many of the other novels and collections Garcia Marquez published in the decades to follow would be among the rare literary works to enjoy both popular and critical success. Its themes and characters swirled throughout all his books: savage political violence, passions romantic and otherwise, ghosts, family secrets, idealistic questing madmen and, always, the practical yet mystical women who grounded them -- female avatars inspired in one way or another by Ms. Barcha, a sharp-witted beauty he had fallen for when they were children.

""Mercedes permeates all my books,"" he once said. ""There's traces of her everywhere."" ""He called her the manager of the crisis department,"" their son Rodrigo Garcia said, ""sometimes without him even knowing what the crisis was."" Mercedes Barcha Pardo was born on Nov. 6, 1932, in Magangue, Colombia. Her father, Demetrio Barcha, was a pharmacist; her mother, Rachel Pardo, was a homemaker. The oldest of seven children, Mercedes grew up in Sucre and then Barranquilla, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where her family moved to avoid the political violence that convulsed the region at midcentury. There, home on holiday from convent school, she re-met Garcia Marquez, who was writing for a local newspaper. As the story goes, he had already proposed marriage the moment he saw her back in Sucre, when she was 9 and he was 14. From the start he found her beautiful and enigmatic, ""with an illusionist's talent for evading questions,"" as he wrote in his 2003 memoir, ""Living to Tell the Tale."" When Garcia Marquez was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent, he wrote to Ms. Barcha regularly. After his newspaper was shut down, he found himself broke in Paris, living in a hotel room and working on a manuscript. Her photo on the wall and a red Olivetti typewriter were among his only belongings. Upon his return to South America in 1957, he paid Ms. Barcha 500 pesos (the equivalent of about $130, or about $1,200 today) to return his letters -- she wouldn't give them up without a prize -- and promptly destroyed them. ""He was years away from being famous,"" Rodrigo Garcia said, ""but he was always very particular about their lives being private. He didn't want the paper trail."" The two married in 1958. On the day of the wedding, Ms. Barcha waited to put on her wedding dress until he had driven up. ""It's not that she doubted him,"" Mr. Garcia said, ""but she had the superstition and the pragmatism of people from a certain world that said, 'There's a one-in-a-million chance that a bridegroom might not appear for his wedding.' So it was just in case.""

Their friend Jorge Eduardo Ritter, who had been Panama's ambassador to Colombia, described Ms. Barcha as akin to a president's adviser. ""She let him know what he needed to know,"" he said. ""She was more informed than he was, having read all the newspapers while he worked each morning."" If she had neglected to give him money for lunch, Mr. Ritter continued, ""He would say, 'Mercedes didn't give me cash, so you will have to pay.'"" When his novel ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" was published in English in 1988, Garcia Marquez told Pete Hamill, who wrote about him for Vanity Fair: ""You write better with all your problems resolved. You write better in good health. You write better without preoccupations. You write better when you have love in your life. There is a romantic idea that suffering and adversity are very good, very useful for the writer. I don't agree at all."" The couple had homes in Mexico City and Cuernavaca, Mexico; in Barcelona and Paris; in Cartagena and Barranquilla, Colombia; and, rather problematically, in Havana, a so-called protocol house lent them by Fidel Castro, to whom Garcia Marquez remained a loyal friend, confounding almost everyone. Because of their friendship, the United States government denied Garcia Marquez an unrestricted visa until President Bill Clinton, a fan, invited him to Martha's Vineyard in 1995 (although before then he had been issued waivers to receive a visa whenever he wanted to visit the United States). Even in that friendship, apparently, Ms. Barcha had the upper hand. As Garcia Marquez told Jon Lee Anderson of The New Yorker, who profiled him in 1999, ""Fidel trusts Mercedes even more than he does me.""

""It was one of those epic marriages,"" Mr. Anderson said in a phone interview. ""Mercedes ran the practical side. She unmoored him from the quotidian exigencies of everyday life."" Each of their homes, he recalled, was identically decorated, with white furniture and carpets, modern art, the same clothes in the closet and the same Apple computer. ""There's a Spanish phrase: 'polo a tierra,' the thing you ground a house with,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""She was his grounding, his connection to the earth."" ""She was also insatiably curious about the world and its goings-on; they both were,"" he added, ""and they were wise-eyed in this very intrinsic way. They came from a similar part of Colombia, from these little backwater river towns where violence was a fact of everyday life."" Mr. Garcia said his parents ""had this idea of marriage that was also a kind of complicity. It wasn't just the love, it was the things that were just between the two of you. ""People say she was the gatekeeper,"" he continued. ""I think that's a little facile. There is a gatekeeper when there is a gate to be kept.

Opinion,The George Floyd Election,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/george-floyd-trump-biden.html,"Mike Erlandson, a former chairman of the state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, told Politico that the rioting could convert two relatively safe suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul Democratic House seats into competitive battlegrounds: Both of those districts will be decided in large part by suburban women voters, and it would be hard for me to imagine those people aren't watching this scared, like everybody else, for their family and for their children. What Democrats fear most is a repetition of the voter reaction to urban rioting in the 1960s that brought an end to decades of Democratic hegemony at every level of government as Republicans were able to set much of the federal, state and local agenda for the next 52 years. The transformation of voting patterns that manifested in the 1968 election is documented by Omar Wasow, a political scientist at Princeton. In his May 2020 paper, ""Agenda Seeding: How 1960s Black Protests Moved Elites, Public Opinion and Voting,"" Wasow compared voting in predominately white counties close to violent protests in 1968 to those that were not. Violent protests likely caused a 1.6 percent to 7.9 percent shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election. In contrast, the Democratic vote in white counties that directly experienced, or were in proximity to, nonviolent protests rose by 1.6 percent. Based on these calculations, Wasow estimated what the outcome of the 1968 election would have been under a ""counterfactual scenario that Martin Luther King had not been assassinated on April 4, 1968 and 137 violent protests had not occurred in the immediate wake of his death."" Under this scenario, Wasow wrote, ""Hubert Humphrey would have won an additional 763,040 votes nationally,"" including a majority of the votes in five additional states: Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, and Ohio. These swing states would collectively have provided Humphrey with an additional 84 electoral votes and allowed him to win the 1968 election with a total of 275 electoral votes. The current situation not only raises Democratic concerns over a repetition of 1968, but also a repetition of 2016.

They note that other studies have found that political violence is associated with a ""backlash"" effect; voters behave unsympathetically toward the perceived rioting group. In the United States, this means increased support for socially and politically conservative candidates and policies. Ryan, Kaufman and Sands write that reasons for ""the differences between our findings and prior research"" include the possibility that ""a single riot invokes sympathy"" while ""a series of riots provokes backlash."" In addition, ""those observing the riot from afar may lack sympathy because they do not share an identity with the rioters."" Interestingly, the profound levels of partisan polarization that obtain in 2020 are likely to lock voters into support for the candidates of their chosen political party. The freezing of millions of votes before the contest even begins means that a much smaller share of the electorate can be swayed by new developments, making the impact of urban disorder much less than it was in 1968, when voters' attachment to political parties was less intense. In a January 2020 paper, ""Cross-Country Trends in Affective Polarization,"" three economists, Levi Boxell and Matthew Gentzkow, both of Stanford, and Jesse M. Shapiro, of Brown, measured voter polarization from 1978 to 2018. They found that the level of polarization in the United States nearly doubled over those four decades, increasing at a much faster pace than in eight other developed nations, Canada, Switzerland, New Zealand Australia, Britain, Norway, Sweden, and German. While Democrats struggle to capitalize on their strengths and compensate for their vulnerabilities, the most challenging political terrain involves questions of race. Brian Schaffner of Tufts University argues that the current prominence of racially charged issues may cost liberals some votes: November is a long way off, and it is very possible that these protests will be a distant memory by then and that a new coronavirus outbreak or continued economic crisis will be the main talking points as the election nears. Then he added another thought: That said, it's possible that the protests will help Trump. In 2018, Democrats won back some of the Obama-Trump voters, and those Obama-Trump voters that they won back looked like the Democratic base on many issues, but were much farther away from the party's base when it came to issues of race. in general like the Democratic Party's positions on bread and butter economic and social welfare politics, but seem to be less comfortable with the racial justice platform. So elevating the salience of the latter may drive some swing voters back to Trump. Schaffner provided data showing that voters who backed Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016 are close to mainstream Democrats on such issues as banning assault weapons and Medicare for All. They are, however, substantially more conservative that the Democratic base electorate on issues of white privilege and the border wall.

will look at all of the chaos happening in the United States right now -- protests, violence, coronavirus, economic crisis -- and simply decide that Trump is just not up to the job. With the situation as it is, there may be a desire among many to put the country in the hands of an experienced professional politician like Biden. What makes the moment unique is that the combination of widespread racial discontent, the pandemic and the economic implosion is taking place at a time when the scope of deprivation and need is extraordinary. The number of people who are out of work without income now tops 40 million. There is the prospect of an ""avalanche of evictions"" forcing millions of renters into homelessness as legal protections and government assistance come to an end. The University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute estimates that ""42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss."" Families will increasingly begin to experience the incalculable depth of loss as the election approaches, and traditional political maneuvering will be subordinated to the less familiar and highly volatile politics of scarcity. Scarcity can bring out the best and the worst in us, but with Trump in the White House for the next seven months the likelihood of a beneficial outcome is slim to none. Trump's behavior this week has prompted extreme fear among some of those on the left. ""Authoritarians, often mentally unstable people with deeply narcissistic needs, transform this kind of chaos into dictatorships,"" David Leege, a professor emeritus of political science at Notre Dame, wrote in an email. Leege suggested that the president's actions Monday night offer a parallel to the rise of fascism in the 1930s, when Trump signaled his intent to seize power, sending troops to any state where the governor did not mobilize the forces of order to physically beat back and punish harshly any protesters who did not desist. To model for the nation his strength, he called out the troops to restore order to Washington, D.C. How the protests, both peaceful and violent, will play out on Nov. 3 remains uncertain. Perry Bacon Jr., a senior writer at FiveThirtyEight.com, points out that over the last decade, many whites, especially white Democrats, ""have become increasingly conscious of discrimination against black Americans -- particularly in the years since Trayvon Martin was shot and killed in 2012 and Michael Brown was shot and killed in 2014."" The looting of drugstores and high-end retail -- much of it videotaped and repeatedly broadcast -- may undermine the strength of these emerging liberal convictions. But will that matter more than Floyd's stark death, which also exists on tape for all to see?",How the protests come to be viewed may determine who the next president is. The way that will play out could surprise us.,32d42c23-4bd8-504a-8151-912b4c3f002d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/03/opinion/03edsall1/03edsall1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3d5d07fbba34a3ced9dc75ae7f4e3ab7960b543214faec93c4ef55dc1f9ae24a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Protests over the killing of George Floyd in New York City on Monday.,32d42c23-4bd8-504a-8151-912b4c3f002d,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/32d42c23-4bd8-504a-8151-912b4c3f002d.jpg,11
Books,"For Black and Mixed-Race Women, Hair and Identity Are Tangled Together",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/books/review/that-hair-djaimilia-pereira-de-almeida.html,"What do we lose in translation? How do we know we're getting the story right? In the Portuguese writer 's slim third novel, ""That Hair,"" this question feels particularly salient, given the nontraditional structure of the narrative. Even in its English translation (from a language that Eric M. B. Becker, the translator, calls ""at odds"" with this one), Pereira de Almeida's semi-autobiographical ""hybrid novel"" is a challenging read. It feels less like a novel than a collection of essays linked together by the author's preoccupation with her hair -- or, rather, the hair of her narrator, Mila. But as anyone blessed to be black knows, one's identity is inextricably wound up in one's hair. Fact or fiction, that is ultimately what this book is all about.

Mila begins by telling us, ""The story of my curly hair intersects with the story of at least two countries and, by extension, the underlying story of the relations among several continents: a geopolitics."" The daughter of a blond Portuguese father and a Black Angolan mother, Mila leaves her native Angola at the age of 3 to live with her paternal grandparents in Lisbon. We learn that Mila's mother has remained in Africa, to visit her daughter only occasionally, but the details about her mother's life, and how this absence unmoors Mila, are frustratingly scarce.

Instead Pereira de Almeida chooses to contextualize Mila's arc using the paths her paternal and maternal grandparents took separately and together, crisscrossing Portugal's African colonies to eventually arrive in Lisbon. It's a fascinating back story, offering a glimpse into the legacy of colonialism, but tracing her ancestors' journeys from Africa to Europe doesn't quite help Mila understand her own place in the world.","In ""That Hair,"" the Portuguese writer Djaimilia Pereira de Almeida uses a young half-Angolan girl in Lisbon to explore her own Afro-European selfhood.",7e7703aa-4180-57a3-9781-c74a25d31afb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/books/review/22Tharps1/Tharps1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bfe3c45923c489b7d086330685fb31a4b0e9e7b3c80f6f051fc20d60b5504f2f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Djaimilia Pereira de Almeida,7e7703aa-4180-57a3-9781-c74a25d31afb,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/7e7703aa-4180-57a3-9781-c74a25d31afb.jpg,13
Books,A Contemporary Feminist Spin on the Traditional Pioneer Novel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/books/review/madeline-ffitch-stay-and-fight.html,"Motivated in part by guilt as a privileged outsider, Helen invites a local lesbian couple, Lily and Karen, and their newborn son, Perley, to join her on the land. For years they share an insular, antisocial utopia, united by their anticapitalist eagerness to eke out an existence eating boiled nettles and acorns. Forget other people, Lily decides after the three of them construct a ramshackle cabin, which is promptly infested by black snakes: ""It was each other we wanted.""

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of July. See the full list. ]

Karen and Lily call their parenting style ""dignity of risk,"" and when 7-year-old Perley is bitten by one of the snakes, the family is cast out of paradise and into disarray. Seeing his face wound, the school principal reports the family to Children's Services, whose agents remand the boy to foster care. To get him back, Karen joins an oil-pipeline crew to earn enough cash for court-ordered property improvements. There she discovers the pipeline is headed right for Helen's land, where construction could eventually devastate their land and force them all to flee.

In a 2017 essay for Granta, ffitch recounted her own family's experience attending protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, ominously nicknamed the ""black snake."" She's borrowed that image to serve as the central metaphor of her novel, the snake that bites Perley mirroring the danger of the pipeline that slithers toward Helen's land.

At the novel's climax, the snakes both metaphorical and literal seem poised to destroy this backwoods Eden. An exasperated Karen has quit her crew in defeat; Perley remains in foster care, ""hopped up on some kind of meds."" When Karen firebombs a compressor station that services the pipeline, the act seems less heroic than desperate. ""Too bad that kind of thing doesn't create lasting change,"" Helen remarks upon reading of the eco-sabotage in the newspaper.

In that Granta essay, ffitch described the tension between activism and fiction. ""Rather than claiming certainty or authority where none exists, storytellers stay honest by writing about what we ourselves don't fully understand."" ""Stay and Fight"" succeeds in mapping the obscure psychological and emotional territory that defines a life caught between commitment and ambivalence, between rebellion and resignation.","In Madeline ffitch's debut, ""Stay and Fight,"" an urbane hipster finds herself when she relocates to Appalachia.",c030fbee-2601-54f5-a9df-75fa8c13368c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/27/books/review/Enzinna1/Enzinna1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=226&w=432&s=8ea1d7a80d891280731fa6443cbdef64247d3cc6ad59ae91c14d8289c2f7747e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Madeline ffitch's debut novel, ""Stay and Fight,"" succeeds in mapping the peculiar psychological territory that defines a life caught between commitment and ambivalence.",c030fbee-2601-54f5-a9df-75fa8c13368c,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/c030fbee-2601-54f5-a9df-75fa8c13368c.jpg,13
Media,Minnesota Public Radio Drops Garrison Keillor Over Allegations of Improper Conduct,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/business/media/garrison-keillor-fired.html,"Minnesota Public Radio said Wednesday that it was severing all business ties with Garrison Keillor, the creator and retired host of ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" after allegations of ""inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him."" Over four decades, Mr. Keillor, 75, had created a financial juggernaut for the radio network with his weekly broadcast of songs, skits and tales of his fictional hometown Lake Wobegon, along with related books, recordings and other products. In a statement he provided to The New York Times, Mr. Keillor said, ""I've been fired over a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard. Most stories are."" Effective immediately, MPR said, it will no longer distribute and broadcast Mr. Keillor's remaining programs, ""The Writer's Almanac"" and ""The Best of A Prairie Home Companion Hosted by Garrison Keillor.""

It will also change the name of American Public Media's current incarnation of the show, which Chris Thile, a songwriter and mandolinist, took over in October 2016, after Mr. Keillor stepped down. Jon McTaggart, the president of Minnesota Public Radio, said in a statement that ""all of us in the MPR community are saddened by these circumstances."" He added: ""While we appreciate the contributions Garrison has made to M.P.R., and all of public radio, we believe this decision is the right thing to do and is necessary to continue to earn the trust of our audiences, employees and supporters of our public service."" The network did not elaborate on what it called Mr. Keillor's ""inappropriate behavior."" Later on Wednesday, The Star Tribune of Minneapolis published an email from Mr. Keillor in response to a reporter's questions, giving his version of an encounter with an unidentified woman. ""I put my hand on a woman's bare back,"" he wrote. ""I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it.""

Mr. Keillor claimed that they continued to be friends ""right up until her lawyer called."" He insisted his discomfort with physical affection was common knowledge, adding, ""If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the beltline, I'd have at least a hundred dollars."" Mr. Keillor is one of many public figures to face consequences after allegations of sexual misconduct in recent weeks. Indeed, just a day earlier, he had come to the defense of his friend and fellow Minnesotan, Senator Al Franken, who is fighting for his political life in the face of accusations of improprieties from four women. In an op-ed for The Washington Post published on Tuesday evening, Mr. Keillor said calls for the senator's resignation were ""pure absurdity"" and dismissed a photograph of the Democrat with his hands on a woman's chest as something ""in a spirit of low comedy.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The fallout with the network came as Mr. Keillor was slowly receding from the public stage, though he has still been touring, with appearances around the Northeast this week. On Wednesday, he canceled a performance scheduled that night in Pittsfield, Mass. He originally came up with the idea for his own Americana variety program in 1974 after he traveled to Nashville to write about the Grand Ole Opry for The New Yorker. ""A Prairie Home Companion"" became a radio institution, peaking at 4.1 million weekly listeners a decade before he retired, with lucrative live performances and merchandise that included recordings, books and clothes.

Mr. Keillor sang, performed in skits with recurring characters like Guy Noir and ended each show with a monologue about Lake Wobegon, ""where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking and all the children are above-average."" Famous artists who appeared on his stage included Emmylou Harris, Chet Atkins, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Taj Mahal, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Keb' Mo' and Wilco. He was credited with shaping the early profile of public radio. ""'Prairie Home Companion' came on the scene just as public radio was trying to figure out what its identity was,"" Ira Glass, the host of ""This American Life,"" told The New York Times last year. ""The fact that here was such a visibly weird, funny, idiosyncratic show opened up the space of other weird, idiosyncratic shows, like 'Car Talk,' and our show."" Mr. Keillor, in his statement on Wednesday, which he also published on his website, said he was ""deeply grateful"" for all the years appearing on the radio and touring the country. ""It's some sort of poetic irony to be knocked off the air by a story, having told so many of them myself, but I'm 75 and don't have any interest in arguing about this,"" he said. ""And I cannot in conscience bring danger to a great organization I've worked hard for since 1969."" He also apologized to ""all the poets whose work I won't be reading on the radio and sorry for the people who will lose work on account of this.""","The network says it has severed all business ties with Mr. Keillor, the creator of ""A Prairie Home Companion.""",ffc5888c-af9f-5898-b5db-e838334b487e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/business/30xp-Keillor/30xp-Keillor-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a80952347be8286a7a3779bd429077934b21b74a521984eef77af2a0c3f813a9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Garrison Keillor in 2016.,ffc5888c-af9f-5898-b5db-e838334b487e,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/ffc5888c-af9f-5898-b5db-e838334b487e.jpg,16
Automobiles,"Working in Postwar Italy, He Was the da Vinci of the V6",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/automobiles/working-in-postwar-italy-he-was-the-da-vinci-of-the-v6.html,"The question of which engine type is best for powering the cars of the masses may never have a single, unchanging answer. When the V8 prevailed on American roads, it was an appropriate choice for large vehicles in an era of cheap fuel. Times have changed; the workhorse auto engines of our era are those that fit in the narrow engine compartments of the millions of front-wheel-drive cars. For that reason, the V6 has become ubiquitous in full-size family sedans, and in-line 4 cylinders have come to dominate the overall market as vehicles shrink. Many factors have been considered in establishing these norms. The in-line 6, once dominant, is still favored by BMW and others because of its naturally smooth operation, but aside from a handful of exceptions, it is too long to fit under the hood of front-drive models.

In-line 4s that typically power small front-drive cars are attractive to automakers; with fewer parts, they are cheaper to build. But such engines have shortcomings. Their natural imbalance requires the complication of a counterbalancer system to offset vibration, and their less-frequent firing pulses -- two per revolution, or half as many as a V8 -- can generate a driveline vibration felt by passengers under some driving conditions. That makes engines with more cylinders desirable, but they must be contained in a package of short overall length. Today's answer is a V6 engine. These same requirements existed in the late 1930s at Lancia, a small Italian manufacturer. The company needed a smoother, more powerful engine that would fit into an existing, rather narrow engine bay. Lancia had previously solved such problems by building compact engines that arranged the cylinders in a narrow V shape, with both cylinder banks sharing a single cylinder head. Such extreme compactness compromised performance (though Volkswagen was later successful in adopting a similar scheme for its VR6 engine). Something new was needed. Lancia had been founded in 1906 by a racing driver, Vincenzo Lancia. The company made its place by building cars known for exceptional construction and driving qualities, yet priced below the top end of the expanding auto market. (Lancia became part of Fiat in 1969.) The company was a pioneer of unit body construction and 4-wheel independent suspension.

A young engineering graduate, Francesco De Virgilio, was hired at Lancia in 1939 and put to routine tasks. He soon attracted management's attention by improving and simplifying the suspension of a Lancia model. In 1941 he was transferred to the test department, working under Vittorio Jano, one of the outstanding designers of the 20th century. De Virgilio spent the summer of 1943 analyzing the vibration of alternative V-angles for a possible V6 engine. Engine balance been given little attention in the early days of motoring because engine speeds, and therefore shaking forces, were low, but as engines were made smaller and higher-revving, controlling vibration became more important. Today, engineers let their computer workstations pop out solutions to deal with vibration problems. Easy answers of this kind have been a blessing and a curse. They are a blessing because junior engineers no longer need to spend weeks in pencil-and-paper calculation as De Virgilio did. They are a curse because instant computer solutions do not confer the insight that De Virgilio gained. De Virgilio's career is chronicled in a new, generously illustrated book, ""Lancia and De Virgilio at the Center,"" by Geoffrey Goldberg (David Bull Publishing, 2014). The book has the graceful quality and range of an artist's biography, properly treating De Virgilio's entire life as relevant to his work. He is depicted with his family, at work and at the racetrack. (Fangio was a Formula One champion in the Lancia D-50, fielded by Ferrari, in 1956.) There are reproductions of many of his sketches and drawings as well as photos of the hardware he created. De Virgilio showed his superiors that a V6 with its cylinder banks positioned at a 60-degree V angle and a crankshaft with six crankpins -- the section where the connecting rods attach -- spaced at 60-degree intervals could be made uniquely smooth-running. There was official resistance to his conclusion, because, as the automotive historian Karl Ludvigsen has noted, the V6 was a ""virtually unknown engine type in the 1950s."" Even so, Lancia's team built, evaluated and rejected as less smooth alternative designs before accepting De Virgilio's solution. In the end, Jano, Lancia's chief engineer, chose De Virgilio's V6 to power the very influential 1950 Lancia Aurelia. De Virgilio's solution was a crankshaft with four main bearings and six crankpins; his design resulted in evenly spaced firing intervals and a low-vibration power plant. (By contrast, many of the V6s that followed were built like V8s, with pairs of connecting rods bolted side-by-side on each of the three crankpins.)

Offsetting the crankpins, as De Virgilio did, weakened the crankshaft because each pair of crankpins was joined to a disc between them, with almost no overlapping metal between each pair of pins. Like most engineering decisions, this was a compromise; at the engine speeds prevalent in that era, the engines were reliable, and the result was a new kind of smooth, compact automotive power plant. The Aurelia it powered was a streamlined sporting sedan that strongly influenced subsequent European auto design. When, in 1956, Enzo Ferrari wanted a head-start on 1957's new Formula Two racing class, he engaged Jano as a consultant. With the Aurelia's competition success in mind, a six-crankpin V6 to power the Ferrari racecar was drawn up, widening the V angle to 65 degrees to make room for three dual-throat carburetors. Later production V6 auto engines had a less elegant origin -- as utilitarian cost-cutters. Buick built an aluminum V8 during the early 1960s (later used in Land Rovers), but it was expensive. The project manager, Joseph D. Turlay, made a simplifying proposal: Chop off two cylinders to make a shared-crankpin V6 and give it a low-cost iron block. This saved money by allowing V6s to be produced on modified V8 tooling, even though the result was neither ideally balanced (the engines are sometime called paint shakers) nor did it have an even firing interval. These shortcomings were masked by the use of soft engine mounts. Buick's first Fireball V6 arrived in 1962, and a smoother even-fire engine with six separate crankpins came late in 1977. De Virgilio's V6 work was modern in the sense that he was trying to package engine functions to fit external requirements. Automakers in need of a short engine with more than 4 cylinders have made millions of 90-degree V6s, saving money by sharing tooling with V8s. Those compromise V6s were not as smooth as De Virgilio's solution of 1943 -- a configuration now broadly embraced -- but they were effective automobile power plants.","An innovative design by Francesco De Virgilio, introduced more than 60 years ago, is the basis for many modern 6-cylinder engines.",f7af67a1-d43a-5949-a837-1fcc7f8b2a98,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/14/automobiles/14ENGINE3/ENGINE3-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=692&w=600&s=81edea041518474f1f7b5b67e92ca857a8ee3ca1c14645b495eaafa5b5955273&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Francesco De Virgilio in 1990 with his V6.,f7af67a1-d43a-5949-a837-1fcc7f8b2a98,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/f7af67a1-d43a-5949-a837-1fcc7f8b2a98.jpg,23

Automobiles,'Rush': The Drama Is Off the Track,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/automobiles/rush-the-drama-is-off-the-track.html,"Hollywood has long tried to make films about auto racing that would strike a chord with general audiences. So far, the commercial successes have been few -- and, with rare exceptions, the racing has served as little more than a noisy background that fed speed and thrills to another story line. ""I mean, there's John Frankenheimer's 'Grand Prix' from 1966, and that's about it,"" Mario Andretti said in a telephone interview, adding that he had seen almost every racing movie made. ""Grand Prix"" won three Academy Awards for technical achievement; an auto racing movie has never won an Oscar for Best Picture. ""I'm sorry, that's it,"" Andretti said, offering a critique informed by the many championships to his credit. But that bleak assessment could change. Andretti said he had hope for the prospects of the new Ron Howard film, ""Rush,"" which chronicles the 1976 Formula One season and the duel between Niki Lauda and James Hunt for that year's driver championship. The movie opens nationwide on Sept. 27.

""It was probably a good choice for subject matter on the part of the filmmakers,"" said Andretti, whose opinion carries extra weight because he raced, and won, against both men. Moreover, he won the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix, the climax of both the racing season and the movie. It was a season full of dramatic twists. Lauda had won five races when the circuit came to the Nurburgring for the German Grand Prix, where his Ferrari spun into a guardrail and caught fire. His helmet came off, and he suffered extensive burns. Though Lauda missed two races while he was hospitalized, he still led Hunt in World Championship points when, despite his painful injuries, he returned to competition just six weeks after the near-fatal crash. Pulling a helmet down over his burns was every bit as excruciating as depicted in the movie, Lauda said at the London premiere on Sept. 2. He said the movie was so realistic that it helped him to recall forgotten details of the crash. ""Although I never lost consciousness, I never realized what my rescuers were doing to try to keep me alive,"" he said. ""I was only concerned with my own survival.""

Although the battle for the championship was compelling in its own right, where the film has received the most praise is in the script and the highly charged chemistry between the actors who play the main characters -- Daniel Bruhl as the dour Lauda and Chris Hemsworth as the flamboyant Hunt. ""Most modern-era car racing movies, from 'Grand Prix' and 'Le Mans' to 'Days of Thunder', have been far stronger at portraying the excitement on the track than at developing interesting downtime drama among the characters,"" wrote Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter, noting that the reverse is true with ""Rush,"" which devotes far more time to exploring the personalities of the drivers. ""Mozart vs. Salieri. Kennedy vs. Khrushchev. Gates vs. Jobs,"" Variety's film critic, Peter Debruge, wrote, adding that ""Rush"" is ""not just one of the great racing movies of all time, but a virtuoso feat of filmmaking in its own right, elevated by two of the year's most compelling performances. It's high-octane entertainment that demands to be seen on the big screen, assembled for grown-ups and executed in such a way as to enthrall even those who've never watched a race in their life."" Closer to the sport, the retired Formula One driver David Coulthard said he found the racing scenes credible, although ""no film can quite capture what really goes on inside the car."" ""But I thought the characters were compelling and believable,"" Coulthard said in an interview at the Italian Grand Prix last week. ""I have a rather personal perspective on the two men, as I know Niki, of course, from my association with Mercedes, and I met James when I was a very young driver."" The fast-living Hunt died of a heart attack in 1993 at age 45. One of the few tempered comments about the movie or its performances came from Bernie Ecclestone, who controls the commercial rights to Formula One. At the Italian Grand Prix, Mr. Ecclestone said that no one could ever play Hunt like Hunt himself: ""He would have livened the film up a lot.""","Ron Howard's film, which chronicles the duel between Niki Lauda and James Hunt for the 1976 Formula One driver championship, has racing greats fired up.",0b5c86ae-81bd-5f9b-854a-d5a9b3c231f2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/15/automobiles/Rush/Rush-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=248&w=600&s=d600fe7a8133df23b0a1a310e65171dd2eea3be267f06deb16621d4544ca4fc1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"MOODY  On-track clashes play a role, but it's the driver personalities that distinguish ""Rush"" from other racing films.",0b5c86ae-81bd-5f9b-854a-d5a9b3c231f2,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/0b5c86ae-81bd-5f9b-854a-d5a9b3c231f2.jpg,23
Opinion,Who Bears Witness to a Hidden Epidemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/opinion/sunday/domestic-violence-coronavirus.html,"We know domestic violence is spiking under lockdown -- we just don't know the details. Here are women who do.

Within the first few weeks of states' going into lockdown, reports began flooding in from domestic violence hotline centers throughout the country: They were seeing spikes in calls. But as sheltering-in-place dragged on, the calls for help dropped off. To those familiar with the dynamics of intimate-partner violence, this was not a good thing.

That domestic violence is part of the story of this pandemic is well known: Lockdowns have made it more difficult for domestic violence survivors to distance themselves from their abusers; orders of protection often take longer to come through because courts aren't operating at full capacity; experts have viewed the decline in calls for help with alarm, as it suggests survivors might not be able to get away from abusers long enough to reach out.

But if covering domestic violence, which takes place mainly behind closed doors, is difficult in normal times, telling the story of its rise during a time of lockdowns and quarantines poses an even bigger challenge. That is why Christopher Lee, a photographer, opted to focus on the hotline workers. He began photographing them in the Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston metro areas in May. According to Dr. Noel Busch-Armendariz, director of the Institute on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault at the University of Texas at Austin, 38 percent of adult women in Texas in 2011 reported having been in an abusive relationship. The stay-at-home orders have had a severe effect on the most vulnerable women, and domestic violence centers are bracing themselves for the worst. In Texas, which reported record numbers of daily cases of Covid-19 four times last week, the governor signaled on Friday the possibility of a new economic ""lockdown"" if the state cannot curtail its outbreak.

Like so many people around the globe, those who answer phones for domestic violence hotlines are working from home during the coronavirus pandemic. With the benefit of technology, advocates and counselors have been fielding calls, texts and emails from survivors from their kitchen tables and living rooms. Their experiences on one end of these calls help shed light on stories going untold.

Veronica Hernandez, a hotline operator and advocate at SAFE Austin, says she's seen an uptick in reports from a wider array of survivors than usual: men who've been abused, youth who've been trafficked and people who've been hurt by nonromantic partners such as roommates. She's also sensed that those who call have grown more desperate -- she hears more frequently from women who are actively fleeing danger or have already had violent interactions with their abuser. Before the pandemic, callers would be more likely to say they had experienced non-life-threatening behavior or abuse, such as emotional or psychological abuse or behavior that could evolve into something violent. Now they are getting calls that go from zero to 60 in an instant.

As the stories have grown more desperate, the work has grown more challenging. Hotline workers who once counted on the commute between office and home to decompress from stressful professional lives no longer have that sense of separation. ""Bystander trauma is real,"" said Milisa Alexis-Flores, the managing attorney for the Houston office of Aid to Victims of Domestic Abuse, a nonprofit that provides legal aid to domestic violence survivors. ""We all experience it doing this line of work when you consume other people's trauma for a living. That's just the nature of the job and it's always challenging, but it's more challenging in a different way when you're doing it at home.""

But ""I at least am still able to try to decompress in the safety of my home, which my client cannot do,"" Ms. Alexis-Flores said. These images don't quite shed light on the domestic violence that is currently on the rise in private spaces around the world. What they do highlight is the parallel world of the hotline operators, working from their homes, speaking over the phone to survivors calling from rooms that at first glance probably look very similar; what sets them apart is the danger.",We know domestic violence is spiking under lockdown — we just don't know the details.

Technology,"In U.S.-China Tech Feud, Taiwan Feels Heat From Both Sides",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/technology/taiwan-china-tsmc-huawei.html,"TAINAN, Taiwan -- The United States and China are wrestling to lead the world in artificial intelligence, 5G wireless and other cutting-edge technologies. But the real wizardry that makes those advancements possible is being performed on a yam-shaped island that sits between them, geographically and politically. On Taiwan's southern rim, inside an arena-size facility stretched out among lush greenery and coconut palms, colossal machines are manipulating matter at unimaginably tiny scale. A powerful laser vaporizes droplets of molten tin, causing them to emit ultraviolet light. Mirrors focus the light into a beam, which draws features into a silicon wafer with the precision, as one researcher put it, ""equivalent to shooting an arrow from Earth to hit an apple placed on the moon."" The high-performance computer chips that emerge from this process go into the brains of the latest tech products from both sides of the Pacific. Or at least they did until last month, when the Trump administration effectively forced leading chip makers in Taiwan -- and elsewhere -- to stop taking orders from China's proudest tech champion, the 5G giant Huawei. The administration's stranglehold on Huawei shows that for all of China's economic progress, the United States still has final say over the technologies without which the modern world could not run. Chip making relies on American tools and know-how, which gives officials in Washington the power of life and death over semiconductor buyers and suppliers anywhere on the planet.

Next in the firing line is China's most advanced chip producer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation. The U.S. Department of Commerce told American companies last week that they needed permission to export to SMIC, saying its chips could be used by China's military. If the administration blocks SMIC from using American software and equipment entirely, it will sharply set back Beijing's hopes for meeting more of its own semiconductor needs. That leaves Taiwanese chip companies -- including the industry's leading light, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which owns the Tainan plant -- in a tough spot.

They are forced to heed the dictates of American tech policy. Yet they can scarcely ignore the fact that so many of their customers and their customers' customers are in China, where the Communist government is also threatening Taiwan with ever bolder displays of military force. China has for decades claimed the self-governing democracy as part of its territory. In the high-stakes tech fight, TSMC had been playing Finland: a sometime friend to both feuding giants. But that is not the way the tech world works anymore.

""China has virtually no room for maneuver,"" said Pierre Ferragu, the head of technology research at New Street Research. ""The U.S. definitely has the upper hand in the struggle."" Tensions in the Taiwan Strait are rising more broadly this year. The Trump administration has stepped up official exchanges with Taiwan ever since its president, Tsai Ing-wen, won re-election in January over an opponent who was friendlier to Beijing. In response, Chinese aircraft and warships have menaced the island with growing frequency. When a State Department representative, Keith Krach, visited Taiwan recently, Ms. Tsai feted him at a banquet alongside a bevy of government dignitaries and TSMC's retired founder, Morris Chang, a nod to the company's significance to Taiwan's relations with the United States. American officials have taken a great interest in TSMC, whose advanced chips are used in fighter jets and other hardware critical to America's military edge. The company said this year that it would build a new factory in Arizona, responding to American concerns about overreliance on offshore production. Now, the Trump administration's campaign against Huawei has forced TSMC to turn against one of its biggest customers. With the two companies unable to work together without licenses, Huawei may find itself unable to make its late-model handsets, an important chunk of its business, once it uses up its chip inventory. ""I don't think Huawei has much of a future unless they can find some way to get their suppliers to get export licenses,"" said Matt Bryson, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. One of Huawei's deputy chairmen, Guo Ping, said last week that the company was assessing its options.

""Survival is our main goal,"" Mr. Guo said in Shanghai. ""As Alexandre Dumas once said, all of human wisdom is summed up in two words: wait and hope."" TSMC executives sound confident that Huawei's plight will not dent it much. If Huawei cannot order chips from the company, then its rivals will instead. Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said at an industry conference last week that Taiwan would continue improving its technology so American and Chinese companies had no choice but to keep working with the island. ""We are enjoying the success of the past,"" Mr. Liu said. But for the future, ""we cannot stay where we used to be before."" TSMC could still get caught in the middle, though, if the U.S. government's continuing attacks prompt Beijing to strike back. A full-blown clampdown on sales to SMIC could increase the risk of Chinese retaliation ""really significantly,"" said Mr. Ferragu of New Street Research. Countermeasures that Beijing might once have considered too self-defeating -- such as choking off Qualcomm's or Apple's sales in China, effectively depriving Chinese citizens of most high-end smartphones -- could start to seem more acceptable.

For Taiwan, these are not just business questions. China's reliance on TSMC's chips has long made people on the island see the company as a bulwark against Chinese military aggression. At its shareholder meeting this summer, an investor, Huang Hsueh-fen, approached the microphone hugging a giant bouquet. ""No matter how serious the pandemic becomes, I must still come offer flowers to the company that is our sacred mountain, protector of the nation,"" Ms. Huang said. Tech workers in Taiwan have a Mandarin rhyme about the young engineers who put in late nights and sacrifice their health for the company: ""A hundred thousand youths, a hundred thousand livers, shift by shift TSMC is saving Taiwan."" So what happens if China stops needing TSMC as much as it does now? This could happen naturally. TSMC is working at the frontiers of physics to continue doubling the number of transistors it can fit onto a piece of silicon. That principle, known as Moore's Law, has guided semiconductor development for decades. Not all tech products today need the most advanced chips, though. Some work best by packaging high-end processors with less sophisticated ones. Simple ""internet of things"" devices do just fine with simpler chips. ""The way we design chips is changing. It just has to,"" said Jay Goldberg, a tech industry consultant and former Qualcomm executive. ""Moore's Law is slowing, and we're just having to design chips in a way to accommodate that.""

China is trying to poach more Taiwanese talent for the task. Dozens of former TSMC managers and engineers joined two ambitious Chinese chip projects last year, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Ms. Kao of TSMC said recent turnover was less than 5 percent, which the company considered a healthy level. Lin Chih-chieh, a law professor at National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan, said the island needed stronger laws to keep Taiwanese chip makers' trade secrets from being spirited away to China. Still, Ms. Lin said, Taiwan's chip strengths prevent China from subjugating the island as quickly as it did Hong Kong, where the government has curbed civil liberties.",The island's biggest chip maker has been a coveted partner to both battling giants. But rising nationalism is making it harder to keep the middle ground.,9b15aa80-ee3b-5f5a-9055-a94d36196d85,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/28/business/00taiwan-chips-1/00taiwan-chips-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=526b0db5bd418cad33c49e9afc27850636728264763b06f5c62d051d5bb8bf21&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"People in Taiwan have a rhyme about TSMC's workers: Shift by shift, they are saving Taiwan.",9b15aa80-ee3b-5f5a-9055-a94d36196d85,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/9b15aa80-ee3b-5f5a-9055-a94d36196d85.jpg,20
Movies,"Stuart Gordon, Whose Films Reanimated Horror, Dies at 72",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/movies/stuart-gordon-dies.html,"Stuart Gordon, a director best known for lavishly lurid horror films with a piercing sense of humor, notably the cult favorite ""Re-Animator,"" died on Tuesday in Van Nuys, Calif. He was 72. His wife, Carolyn Purdy-Gordon, an actress who appeared in many of his films and with whom he founded the Chicago-based Organic Theater Company, said the cause was multiple organ failure brought on by kidney disease. Mr. Gordon's generally low-budget films often combined the body horror of John Carpenter or David Cronenberg's films with the titillation found in Roger Corman's. He said that surprising moviegoers was an important part of his work, and he did his best to exceed the everyday terrors of many slasher movies. ""There is a side of me that likes to break through cliches and wake people up,"" Mr. Gordon told Rolling Stone in 1986.

Before turning to film, he directed experimental plays at the Organic Theater Company in the late 1960s. The company produced original works, like the comic-book-themed trilogy ""Warp,"" one-third of which briefly made it to Broadway in 1973; it also staged the first production of David Mamet's breakout play, ""Sexual Perversity in Chicago,"" in 1974. ""Re-Animator"" (1985), Mr. Gordon's first feature film, was based on a serialized story about human revivification by H.P. Lovecraft. He wrote the adaptation with Dennis Paoli and William Norris. The movie centers on Herbert West, a medical student played by Jeffrey Combs (he would become a stock player of sorts for Mr. Gordon) who discovers a chemical reagent that returns dead bodies to life. His experiments with it yield ever more grotesque results, culminating in a gang of marauding undead. One unforgettable scene involves the severed head of a reanimated corpse and a captive young woman.

""'Re-Animator' has as much originality as it has gore, and that's really saying something,"" Janet Maslin wrote in her review in The New York Times when the movie opened in New York theaters. The film, she added, ""has a fast pace and a good deal of grisly vitality"" and even ""a sense of humor, albeit one that would be lost on 99.9 percent of any ordinary moviegoing crowd.""

Mr. Paoli, who also worked with Mr. Gordon on later Lovecraft adaptations, said in a telephone interview that the humor-horror hybrid in ""Re-Animator"" and other Gordon films was similar to that in his theater work, which often straddled the line between the serious and the hilarious. ""If you watch someone laughing and you don't hear them, it looks like they're screaming,"" Mr. Paoli said. ""The fact is they're both releases of tension, and Stuart was a genius at storing up that tension and then releasing it over the line in one direction or another."" That same combination of mordant comedy, graphic violence and cosmic horror turned up in Lovecraft derivations like ""From Beyond"" (1986), about a doctor who uses a device to see into alien dimensions and whose pineal gland bursts through his forehead; and ""Dagon"" (2001), about a village of human-fish hybrids who enjoy procreating with people and sometimes skinning them. Not all Mr. Gordon's films were creature features. He, Brian Yuzna and Ed Naha came up with the story for the hit Disney film ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" (1989), and he was an executive producer of the sequel, ""Honey, I Blew Up the Kid"" (1992).

He also made science fiction films, like ""Fortress"" (1992), about a high-tech prison in a dystopian future; and nightmarish dramas, like ""Stuck"" (2007), about a woman who crashes into a homeless man with her car while intoxicated, then drives home with him trapped in her windshield and barely alive. Mr. Gordon adapted the work of other authors, like Edgar Allan Poe (""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" 1991) and Ray Bradbury (""The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,"" 1998). He returned to the work of Mr. Mamet with the film version of his one-act play ""Edmond"" (2005), about a man, played by William H. Macy, who renounces his strait-laced life and goes on a wild tear that ends with murder and a long prison sentence. To Mr. Gordon, the goal of supposedly highbrow theater was not much different from that of a blood-soaked horror film. ""I have never separated art from having a good time,"" he said in 1986. Stuart Alan Gordon was born in Chicago on Aug. 11, 1947, to Bernard and Rosalie (Sabath) Gordon. His father was a supervisor at a cosmetics factory, his mother a high school English teacher. He graduated from high school in Chicago before studying theater at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. At the university Mr. Gordon formed Screw Theater, an experimental troupe that incensed the college authorities with a 1968 production of ""Peter Pan"" that featured a nude dance sequence. Mr. Gordon and Ms. Purdy, who was in the show, were arrested after the second performance, and the university demanded that Mr. Gordon submit future scripts in advance and allow faculty members into every rehearsal. Mr. Gordon declined and left the university.","His low-budget movies, notably the cult favorite ""Re-Animator,"" combined grisly body horror with a mordant sense of humor.",e2049485-82ff-5197-bc70-4be4f63d1be2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/29/obituaries/29gordon-obit1/24gordon-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c9e89045491df6b2332318b7530b799797b6d250ac7d3de195d57db9ae16028c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The director Stuart Gordon in 2008.

Travel,TripAdvisor to Stop Selling Tickets to Many Animal Attractions,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/travel/tripadvisor-to-stop-selling-tickets-to-many-animal-attractions.html,"TripAdvisor, one of the world's largest travel websites, and its booking service, Viator, will no longer sell tickets to hundreds of attractions where travelers come into contact with wild animals or endangered species held in captivity, the company announced Tuesday. The attractions include elephant rides, swimming-with-dolphin experiences and the petting of endangered species like tigers. The decision, the first of its kind by a leading travel booking site, came after roughly six months of research and consultation with animal groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Association of Zoos and Aquariums (A.Z.A.), Global Wildlife Conservation (G.W.C.) and others. ""TripAdvisor is a leader in the industry and we understand and applaud that this is a precedent-setting move,"" a corporate liaison for PETA, Stephanie Shaw, said. PETA and other animal welfare groups say dolphins and elephants held in captivity for entertainment purposes can suffer severe physical and psychological damage.

TripAdvisor also announced the creation of a wildlife tourism education portal, in partnership with leading animal protection organizations, that will inform the site's users who review attractions and general visitors about animal welfare issues. ""We believe the end result of our efforts will be enabling travelers to make more thoughtful choices about whether to visit an animal attraction and to write more meaningful reviews about those attractions,"" TripAdvisor's chief executive and co-founder, Stephen Kaufer, said in a statement. All animal attractions, even those that will no longer be bookable, will remain on the site in the review section, as long as they follow standard listing procedures, but will be marked with a ""PAW"" icon that will link to the education portal with ""numerous points of view"" relevant to the animals involved from a variety of organizations, TripAdvisor said. TripAdvisor will stop selling tickets to some attractions immediately, but the totality of the booking policy changes, as well as the educational portal, will not be completely implemented until early 2017. There will also be an appeals process for the hundreds of affected attractions should they be able to prove they are within the new policy, the company said. Last October, Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, which will be working with TripAdvisor on its education initiative, released a comprehensive study on wildlife tourism. Among its many findings was that between two million and four million tourists per year pay to visit attractions that are considered harmful to animal welfare, and that a large majority of TripAdvisor reviews for such attractions failed to mention animal welfare concerns.

""I think the average person would think that there's animals there, there's gotta be laws and regulations behind what's happening, but that's not the case, even in places like the U.S.,"" Wes Sechrest, the chief scientist and chief executive of the conservation group G.W.C., said. The entire initiative began several months ago after animal groups and users in the TripAdvisor community expressed concerns, the company said. In April, the World Animal Protection (W.A.P.) agency singled out TripAdvisor in its ""Wildlife, not entertainers"" campaign, asking for signatures on a petition calling for the types of changes that the company is now promising to implement. W.A.P. will now be partnering with TripAdvisor on its educational initiative. While most of the animal groups involved in this effort echoed PETA's overall approval of the new policies, not all groups had every concern addressed. ""There are some areas that I think every one of these groups we spoke with would agree on, and there are some that are not universally agreed upon,"" TripAdvisor's chief marketing officer, Barbara Messing, said. ""We just had to, at the end of the day, come to our own conclusions internally about what makes sense for us and what we thought reflected the totality of what we learned from the groups."" PETA opposes all activities where animals are kept in captivity for profit, including those at zoos and aquariums, but these attractions will remain bookable. However, add-on attractions that are not in compliance with the new policy will not, TripAdvisor said. TripAdvisor's new policy also includes many exemptions, like feeding programs where visitors are under the supervision of zoo or wildlife officials, such as giraffe feeding at the San Diego Zoo, children's petting zoos with domestic animals and voluntourism programs like the ones at the Elephant Nature Park in Thailand, where contact with elephants is likely for visiting volunteers.

Animal welfare groups are hoping these changes create a ripple effect throughout the travel booking industry. ""TripAdvisor's competitors and others within the travel industry will take note of this, and we hope and expect that many other companies will follow,"" Ms. Shaw of PETA said. TripAdvisor, and its competitors like Expedia, already do not allow bookings that involve killing or injuring captive animals for blood sport, but TripAdvisor is the first travel booking site of its size and influence -- the company reaches 350 million unique visitors per month -- to limit access to attractions featuring more commonly practiced tourist-animal engagement. ""We do think it's an important issue, and we want to be part of the solution,"" Sarah Gavin, vice president of global communications at Expedia, said of animal welfare and the travel booking industry.

Casting Murray is a surefire way to win over an audience. It also means yielding at least part of the movie to him, which is what happens here. He plays a bigger-than-life sybarite whose daughter enlists him to help with her marital woes. If that sounds like a dubious idea for a grown child, it's also a playful conceptual gambit for a director whose father, Francis Ford Coppola, casts his own long shadow.

Murray plays Felix, a retired gallerist and full-time bon vivant who's done ostentatiously well for himself, with a vintage Alfa Romeo in the garage and an Ellsworth Kelly on the mantel. His daughter Laura (Rashida Jones, yet another child of a legendary father) is a writer who's struggling to put words on paper while caring for her two young girls. Her husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans), always seems to be perfunctorily kissing Laura hello or goodbye on his way out the door (to run his generic start-up), leaving her in the soft domestic chaos that envelops her. She may be the heroine of this story, but she isn't the center of her universe.

The plot hinges on Laura's not-unreasonable fear that Dean is no longer interested in her and may be having an affair. All the familiar signs seem to be there, including his business trips and long work hours that often find Laura home with the children. Coppola sketches in Laura's world and its loneliness (ripe terrain for dark thoughts) early and starkly when Dean abruptly pulls away from her embrace one night. The next morning, as Laura tends to the kids, and Dean hurries to leave for work, they move around their kitchen with well-rehearsed choreography. The domestic cacophony may be reassuring, but the coarsening of intimacy is palpable.

Coppola's minimalism can be frustratingly rather than productively diffuse, but her aesthetic reserve suits this story and the diffidence of her heroine. Laura is appealing -- or rather Jones is -- and you're drawn to her just by virtue of her being the lead. Even so it's instructive that the first voice you hear in the movie is Felix's. ""And remember, don't give your heart to any boys,"" he says in voice-over, right after the American Zoetrope credit appears and before the first image materializes. ""You're mine until you get married,"" Felix continues, ""then you're still mine."" A girlish voice laughs and adds an incredulous ""OK, Dad."" And then Chet Baker starts singing.","In Sofia Coppola's latest, Rashida Jones plays a woman worried about her marriage. Who's she gonna call? Bill Murray, a.k.a.

Fashion & Style,Internet Porn Nearly Ruined His Life. Now He Wants to Help.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/fashion/mens-style/anti-internet-porn-addict.html,"Internet Porn Nearly Ruined His Life. Now He Wants to Help.

Alexander Rhodes sat along a stretch of grass, looking out over the Allegheny River. The two of us were sitting in a quiet space on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where we had planned to spend the night in tents camping out. ""The key thing to consider is that I am not a very good businessman,"" he said. ""I'm not really anything but a guy who was addicted to internet porn."" A few years ago, Mr. Rhodes, 26, founded a website as an online space meant to help others who share his particular problem. It has about one million unique visitors each month, he said, and nearly breaks even. Mr. Rhodes, who grew up in western Pennsylvania and worked at Google until recently, is now hoping to make his site into something larger. With the help of his father and other family members, he is transforming part of an abandoned church into a base of operations for his fledgling company.

""It's one thing to look back and regret what happened in terms of growing up, being addicted to internet porn,"" he said. ""You might look back and be like: 'Oh, man. I was a loser. And if I never watched it, my life would be so much better.' And maybe that's true. But at the same time, the fact that I was addicted to internet porn, the fact that I was so mediocre, makes me uniquely qualified to help humanity."" In recent years, Mr. Rhodes has emerged as a spokesman against a ""disease"" that hasn't been officially recognized by the medical establishment. He seemed uneasy with his new status. He was careful with every word and asked to go off the record more than a government official. He would not confirm whether he was involved with someone, saying only that, since giving up pornography ""for good"" in 2013, he has been able to have meaningful relationships with women. In some ways, his story is that of the digital age. His father was a computer programmer, and he was exposed to digital technology from early on. He gravitated to Nintendo Game Boy and eventually moved to the Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation. At 11 or so, he said, he clicked on a banner ad by mistake and found an image depicting rape. By the time he had reached adolescence, so had the internet, and Mr. Rhodes came to rely on high-definition pornography that was easy to find and often free. By college, he was masturbating while watching it up to 14 times a day, he said.

Mr. Rhodes's seeming dependence on porn didn't help matters with his first girlfriend, whom he started dating when he was a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh. It was his first real chance for sustained intimacy, and he blew it. ""I don't think it was all due to internet porn,"" he said. ""But I can tell you that the sex life didn't go very well. I had porn-induced erectile dysfunction -- a very mild form, and this is all very self-diagnosed, because doctors won't diagnose this -- but I was able to maintain an erection by fantasizing about pornography. That was the only way."" In 2011, Mr. Rhodes was lost and in search of support. He created a discussion forum on Reddit on the topic of abstaining from masturbation and pornography. He realized he was far from alone and began his stand-alone site soon after. After college, he continued to build the site while working as a contractor for Google, specializing in data analysis. He said he earned good money and was able to put a good amount into the website (called NoFap.com, from a slang term for masturbation). But he was still using the supposed vice he was railing against. It took another failed relationship to get him to quit.

""I think I was relying on pornography as some kind of emotional crutch,"" he said. ""If anything bad would happen, you would go to porn, because it would always be there. ""I knew it was bad for me,"" he said. ""But I also realized it was bad for women I was involved with, and that was the moment that I said: 'I need to leave this thing behind. It is completely distorting my sexuality to the point where it could actually be harmful or at least not enjoyable for other people who I am involved with.'"" Mr. Rhodes came to believe he had a calling greater than his work in data analysis at Google. ""It wasn't an easy decision,"" he said of his leaving the job last year. ""But ultimately it was what was best for humanity."" The website serves as an online umbrella for men looking to escape pornography. It has advertisements for porn-blocking software and online programs that promote the idea of steering clear of pornography and masturbation. The site also has discussion forums and includes testimonials by men sharing stories of their successes and failures. And it helps match men with ""accountability partners"" meant to serve as Alcoholics Anonymous-style sponsors, to keep a person on the right path. The site generates revenue through subscriptions and advertising, Mr. Rhodes said. To make it into something more robust, Mr. Rhodes needed to ""come out"" as a spokesman of sorts. After he appeared in a New York magazine article in 2013 about men who had quit masturbating, he told his mother what was going on, much to her horror. Other interviews followed.

While his family remains supportive, there are limits. When he showed his mother a recent article in Time magazine in which he was quoted, she said, joking, ""I shouldn't be reading these types of things about my son,"" Mr. Rhodes said, recalling his mother's reaction. On the first day I visited Mr. Rhodes, we climbed the stairs of the former St. Clement Church in Tarentum, Pa. The structure, built in 1906, had long since been abandoned, its pews, confessional and attached school crumbling and gathering dust. His father, Phillip Rhodes, had recently bought the sprawling complex at auction for $50,000. While the church is likely to house other businesses, the younger Mr. Rhodes sees a future there for him and a fully staffed operation. He sat on one side of the church confessional while I sat on the other. ""Tell me the last time you watched porn,"" I said, joking. Despite the location, he has largely kept away from religious people, especially evangelicals wanting to team up with him, even though such a relationship could help fund his work.

""I have viewpoints that don't mesh with their viewpoints,"" Mr. Rhodes said. ""I'm very sex-positive. I'm not a religious person. I'm not someone who supports religion. I'm not against religion, but I don't support it. And I completely, firmly believe in premarital sex."" Mr. Rhodes said he has also endured the wrath of those on the other end of the ideological spectrum. People have tried -- and failed -- to hack the site's servers, and its forums have been bombarded with pornographic images, he said. His father received pornography in the mail, Mr. Rhodes said, and he himself has gotten death threats. ""It's just something you have to deal with and let the proper authorities follow up on anything,"" he said. Soon it would grow terribly cold, making for a terrible night of sleep in spite of a tent and a supposedly insulated sleeping bag that I bought at a suburban Target. On the morning of our second day, Mr. Rhodes sat near the extinguished campfire from the night before, laptop on his knees. Soon we'd be departing the campsite, heading back to the city, to ""civilization."" But first he had to present a webinar for another pornography-addiction outfit. During the chat, he spoke with people who asked about avoiding triggers. As the session continued, he spoke less about pornography than about the need to take care of oneself, both physically and emotionally. He talked about developing good habits and routines, about changing one's life in general. When a health care worker asked about fatigue and how he believed it often led him to pornography, Mr. Rhodes told the man that he needed to take care of his own health as well. ""It's like if you're on an airplane flight,"" Mr. Rhodes said, ""and they say, 'Oh, you have to put your oxygen mask on before assisting others with theirs.' It's because you'll pass out trying to get a mask on to somebody else. You have to make sure you're in a balanced spot in order to best serve other people, in order to best serve the world.""","Alexander Rhodes, the founder of an anti-porn website, sets up shop in an abandoned church.",19068ee7-c56f-5613-b3a5-c4f7c64b729b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/fashion/08-Male-Animal-1/08-Male-Animal-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=ff37c0515a1d577366046a842fbf27e2400474024196b08b6e25aef8dae9df6e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alexander Rhodes, the founder of a pornography recovery website, said giving up porn has allowed him to have meaningful relationships.",19068ee7-c56f-5613-b3a5-c4f7c64b729b,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_1/19068ee7-c56f-5613-b3a5-c4f7c64b729b.jpg,19
