Technology,The Sun Sets. The Wind Dies. But Energy Data Is Relentless.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/technology/personaltech/the-sun-sets-the-wind-dies-but-energy-data-is-relentless.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ivan Penn, who covers alternative energy for The Times from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he's using. Q. A lot of alternative energy is basically technology. What are some of the most unusual ideas around alternative energy you've seen break out over the years? A. Much of the energy sector these days focuses on energy storage -- that's where a lot of innovation is taking place. Because solar and wind energy are intermittent, utilities look for ways to capture the unused power for when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly known, but engineers are also working on storing compressed air generated by using excess solar and wind and releasing it later to power a turbine. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power proposes to turn Hoover Dam into a giant battery by making it a hydro-pumped storage plant. The dam already generates electricity, but the utility wants to pump water back into the upper reservoir to produce more electricity using solar and wind electricity to power the pump -- another form of storage.

But storage isn't the only focus. Engineers continue to study other forms of energy, like capturing the power of ocean waves. And some countries are using the internet for peer-to-peer electricity trading of the solar power they generate. Battery technology is something that everyone wants to see improve. What are the challenges to broader deployment of batteries in the energy sector? The biggest issue has been cost. Batteries have been very expensive, but that's changing fairly quickly. Just as with the rapid drop in price in solar panels, batteries to store electricity have rapidly declined in cost, most likely making them more affordable within the next few years.

How has tech changed the power grid as a whole? Just in the last decade, the 100-year model of utilities producing electricity and selling power to consumers was turned on its head. Improvements in solar panel efficiency and lower product cost enabled consumers on a wide scale to produce their own power and sell it back to the electric grid. The grid was never designed to be a two-way street. So that has led to a reimagining of it. Utility companies must rethink the services they provide. No longer just power companies, utilities provide new services like vehicle charging stations for the growing number of electric cars. Along with producing their own power, people now benefit from improvements in energy efficiency, which has resulted in flat or reduced electricity use across the country -- another adjustment for the power companies. Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, highly efficient appliances and smart technology have changed the way we use power. What kind of tech setup do you have for work? The alternative energy beat often is data driven, so tech is critical. Google Sheets and Excel help me manage data from the United States Energy Information Administration, the Solar Energy Industries Association and the California Solar and Storage Association.

Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love? How do you use it? Our house is full of computers, mostly Apple -- MacBooks, iPads and iPhones -- though we use other tablets as well. The gadgets get their fair share of schoolwork activity, but they're also tools of social media, music, art, websites, programming, Hulu and Netflix. Entertainment is big. So there are several gaming systems, old and more recent, like various Nintendo systems as well as Xbox. But as if all of that weren't enough, my sons built their own computer with money they made during the summer at a fast food chicken restaurant so they could play and make video games they hope to sell. So far they're planning more than developing, but perhaps that might fall under the category of research. How has the tech industry swept into Los Angeles? And how has the city changed as a result? Without a doubt, energy technology is a staple of Southern California, given that the state is the leader in solar power. Residential solar is prolific. But technology is really changing transportation. Of course, there are Uber and Lyft, but electric vehicles have also given rise to new companies like Tesloop, which will take you from Los Angeles to San Diego in a Tesla for as little as $29 (snacks included). Prices go as high as about $84, and all users have to do is register and request a ride online. My daughter sometimes uses the service to get to and from the University of California, San Diego, where she goes to school, or uses ride shares through social media. And the Bird app, which connects people with electric scooters, has become increasingly popular, and perhaps annoying to some. Some areas have banned riding and parking the scooters in their communities. It has changed much of how people live, move and interact.","Alternative power sources have upended the electric grid.

Hala (Geraldine Viswanathan) is a 17-year-old Pakistani-American. She wears a hijab, she skateboards, and she prefers morning masturbation to morning prayers. This awkward Chicago teenager's story could easily have been shaped to fit a typical coming-of-age rebellion film: She has strict parents, has a crush on a boy they wouldn't like, and is sneaking around with him anyway. Instead of playing the scenario for laughs, though, the director Minhal Baig treats her character's hyphenated identity and her search for independence with quiet respect. Baig, who is Muslim and grew up in Chicago, drew upon her own senior year of high school for the film.

If you thought we were already at peak true crime, behold: a fictional series about making true crime media. Kathleen Barber's novel ""Are You Sleeping"" portrays a true-crime podcaster as a heartless vulture, but this adaptation is very much on the podcaster's side. (Sarah Koenig, of ""Serial"" fame, consulted on the show.) Octavia Spencer plays Poppy Parnell, a Bay Area journalist who doubts the evidence that convicted a teenager of murder some 20 years ago. She creates a ""Serial""-style podcast series, which asks the audience to reconsider the case, too (Spencer has Poppy's intimate podcast vocal delivery down pat). Her efforts to free the long-incarcerated Warren Cave (Aaron Paul) are not universally welcomed -- the police, the victim's relatives and even Poppy's own family all have objections, but Poppy plows on.

The serial killer Henry Lee Lucas has taught law enforcement a couple of embarrassing lessons. First, don't offer your perp strawberry milkshakes in exchange for each confession of murder. Second, don't give him case files to study and crime-scene clues to stir his ""memory."" This five-part documentary examines how Texas Rangers and detectives from 40 other states botched the Lucas investigation with these techniques in the early 1980s. Lucas claimed to have randomly murdered more than 600 people around the country (an imaginary spree that was the basis for the 1986 movie ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""). Police kept questioning him about thousands of cases, despite increasing indications that Lucas was making it all up. Authorities now believe Lucas's kills were actually in the single or double digits, meaning hundreds of murders to which he'd confessed were returned into the vast sea of unsolved homicides. In Noah Baumbach's new film, a divorce lawyer played by Alan Alda characterizes the sundering of marital bonds as ""a death without a body."" But the way it plays out here, between the actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and her theater-director husband Charlie (Adam Driver), divorce is more like a love autopsy. The couple starts off wanting an amicable split, but once the expensive lawyers are involved, every stray comment or innocent mistake is scrutinized and weaponized, the story of their marriage rewritten with each cast as the villain to the other. Baumbach's unflinching examination of the imploding union spares neither party, and Johansson and Driver's commitment to their characters is devastating.

The standup comic Ronny Chieng has a lot on his mind, including politics, civil liberties, immigration, consumerism, subway etiquette and wedding planning. But Chieng is at his most incisive when he's blowing up stereotypes: Why do Asian-American immigrants want their first-generation children to become doctors, but then neglect to see doctors themselves? What if Asian-Americans became the impartial referees of all disputes among other races? (""No hatred, just solutions."") And what would it be like if an Asian-American were voted into the White House? This leads to a very funny rant, but Chieng doesn't really seem to be joking. Who knows what Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, then Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins), and Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the future Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce), might have said to each other in private meetings six years ago? In this film, the writer Anthony McCarten and the director Fernando Meirelles imagine that the these two very different churchmen -- one a conservative traditionalist, the other considered a more liberal reformer -- had a momentous dialogue that led to the resignation of one man and the ascension of the other. Discussed are issues of sexual abuse and financial malfeasance, and nothing less than the future of the Roman Catholic Church appears to at stake. Even though the movie is pure speculation, the discussion is riveting, and the master actors Hopkins and Pryce create the illusion of actually having it. Rom-coms have long celebrated stalking -- think Lloyd Dobler and his boombox in ""Say Anything."" The dark conceit of the psychosexual thriller ""You"" is that the obsessive protagonist, Joe Goldberg, sees himself as a romantic hero, despite being a serial killer. Following his Season 1 murder spree, Joe now needs a change of scenery. So for Season 2 he relocates to Los Angeles -- a town he hates, providing much fodder for his biting voice-over. The plot this time is largely derived from Caroline Kepnes' novel ""Hidden Bodies,"" the sequel to her ""You."" An unfortunately named woman, Love (played by Victoria Pedretti from ""The Haunting of Hill House""), comes into Joe's orbit as the bodies start dropping again. Could it be that Joe has finally met his soul mate? Or has he just met his match? The ""Austin Powers"" series, ""Malcolm X"" and ""Searching for Sugar Man.""

It's time to hit the road, as Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) embarks on her first tour, opening for the musician Shy Baldwin on a circuit that takes her from Las Vegas to Florida. Along for the ride, of course, is Midge's manager, Susie Myerson (Alex Borstein), who gets a crash course on contract negotiations. Though a great opportunity for Midge, the tour presents a number of problems, so insecurities are high, nerves are frayed and bad options start to look rather tempting. (It's Vegas, after all.) The show's trademark rat-a-tat repartee only gets better with new banter partners joining the cast: Liza Weil (""Gilmore Girls""), Stephanie Hsu (""The Path"") and Cary Elwes (""Stranger Things"").

Eleven-year-old Jonas Brodsky is both precocious and deaf, and he wants to play Beethoven's Sonata No. 14, a piece the great composer wrote as he was losing his own hearing. In this documentary, Jonas's mom, the filmmaker Irene Taylor Brodsky, combines real footage and animation to tell her son's story, exploring the aural world of a gifted child with cochlear implants. Brodsky's deaf father, Paul, who invented TTY, the first telecommunications device for the deaf, wonders if advances in genetics and technology might mean that ""there will be no deafness in the future."" Brodsky herself suggests that Jonas' musical memory technique turns deafness from a disability into a gift.

The characters in this Tarantino-inflected neo-noir are a new breed of femmes fatales -- less seductive, but more, well, fatal. Although this highly stylized show (there are touches of Lynch and echoes of Hitchcock, too,) is nominally concerned with the activities of the men in the Banished Brawlers gang, the story really revs up when the gang's auxiliary women take charge. Worth extra-close attention is Abigail Spencer's Katherine Harlow, who always seems to be several steps ahead of everybody else. ""All my life, people have been underestimating me,"" she says. She's not complaining -- being underestimated proves to be her secret weapon.

Theater,"Review: In 'Leopoldstadt,' Tom Stoppard Reckons With His Jewish Roots",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/theater/leopoldstadt-review-tom-stoppard.html,"LONDON -- Do you remember? Don't you remember? Can't you remember? Why can't you remember? Variations on those unsettling words -- both explicit and unspoken -- echo through the wrenching final scene of Tom Stoppard's ""Leopoldstadt,"" which opened Wednesday night at Wyndham's Theater in London. They are addressed to a mid-20th century visitor to Vienna, a youngish, defensively British man of slipping poise who appears to have forgotten most of his early childhood. But you could also argue that these questions have been posed, in a sustained murmur, from the very beginning of this richly embroidered portrait of Jewish life in Vienna in the early 20th century. They are questions aimed directly at us, the audience and, by extension, at a wider world conveniently prone to historical amnesia. That would include, above all, the man who wrote this play. A tone of instructional reproach is hardly a quality associated with Stoppard, whose six-decade career embraces a host of exuberantly cerebral plays, from ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" (1967) to the time-traveling ""Arcadia"" (1993). But ""Leopoldstadt,"" which has been polished to a burnished sheen by the director Patrick Marber, holds a singular position in its author's canon. For starters, Stoppard, 82, has said this will probably be his last play. And, more than anything he has written (including his rueful ""The Real Thing""), ""Leopoldstadt"" feels like an act of personal reckoning for its creator -- with who he is and what he comes from. It's not difficult to see ""Leopoldstadt"" as one man's passionate declaration of identity as a Jew.

Judaism never figured conspicuously in Stoppard's earlier work. For much of his life, he never thought of himself as Jewish. Born Tomas Straussler in a small town in Czechoslovakia in 1937, he grew up largely in Britain, taking the name of Stoppard from the Englishman his mother married after his father's death. As Stoppard writes in program notes for the play, his mother rarely spoke of her own history. It was only when a previously unknown Czech relative made contact with him in the 1990s that he learned about his mother's family, many of whom had died during the Holocaust.

The image of a hand-printed family tree is prominent in ""Leopoldstadt,"" among the black-and-white projections and photographs that hover evanescently between scenes. For the record, it is not Stoppard's family that is portrayed in the play, but a prosperous fictional Austrian clan in Vienna. When the play begins, the family is assembled at the comfortably upholstered apartment occupied by the matriarchal Grandma Emilia Merz (Caroline Gruber) and her son, Hermann (Adrian Scarborough), who runs the family textile business. It is Christmas Day, 1899.

Yes, that holiday is being celebrated in this Jewish household, a commingling of traditions that finds droll expression when a child mistakenly tops the towering Christmas tree with a Star of David. For Hermann -- whose wife, Gretl (Faye Castelow), is Catholic -- cultural assimilation is a fait accompli as Austria moves into a new century. Or is it? The group assembled before us may represent a sort of cosmopolitan melting pot, in which conversation touches on the latest play by Schnitzler, the painting of Klimt (for whom Gretl is posing), higher mathematics and the theories of Freud. (This is a Stoppard play.) But as Hermann speaks of his hopes for future social and professional advancement, you sense insecurity pricking at his complacency (an uneasiness that is subtly and expertly conveyed by Scarborough, in the show's most fully realized portrait). That disquiet assumes dramatic form before the first act ends, when a romantic triangle -- or quadrangle, depending on how you look at it (again, this is a Stoppard play) -- forces anti-Semitic sentiment into the open. In the second act, with scenes set during the Depression that followed World War I and in 1938, on the eve of Austria's incorporation into the Third Reich, that sentiment festers into full-blown, terrifying form. Thus we watch the once-resplendent Merz household become increasingly shabby and bare, as what once felt like a familial fortress is transformed into a defenseless sanctuary. (Richard Hudson's artfully evolving set is lighted in a sepia haze by the masterly Neil Austin, and images of the entire clan, posed as if for posterity, become a heartbreaking motif.) We are introduced to new generations of Merzes (in changing-times costumes by Brigitte Reiffenstuel), whose political allegiances and cultural tastes vary widely. But being Jewish is no longer a choice for them, not in the age of National Socialism. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of European history will know what to expect when the family freezes at the sound of someone pounding on the door. That does not make watching what follows any easier. In the final scene, in 1955, a man we had earlier met as a boy returns to the now abandoned apartment. Played by Luke Thallon, he is a successful writer of comic literature and, as far as he knows, a proper Englishman. It seems safe to say that he is a surrogate for Stoppard.

More than any previous Stoppard play -- including the sprawling ""Coast of Utopia"" trilogy, a 9-hour dive into the Russian Revolution -- ""Leopoldstadt"" is a group portrait, and one of uncommon density. (You will probably feel the need to consult the family tree in the program.) The 40-strong cast is, to a person, very good, and they embody their characters with spiky defining detail. That they threaten to get lost in the play's panoramic sweep is partly the point here. But it is also hard to avoid the impression that they exist as illustrative figures in an admonitory history lesson. There's no denying that lesson's emotional power, nor its frightening relevance in 2020, when anti-Semitic acts and language seem increasingly on the rise. That means that although ""Leopoldstadt"" is set in the past, it is Stoppard's most topical play. It is also his most conventional drama by far. A writer who reliably bent time into pretzels in earlier works, Stoppard hews to a fully linear structure here. And while ""Leopoldstadt"" is replete, to the bursting point, with historical fact and political theory, it is mostly devoid of the intellectual jeux d'esprit that have been its creator's signature. This may be the Stoppard play for people who don't normally cotton to Stoppard. It is as if the playwright felt that what he had to say here was too urgent to be filtered through his usual cerebral playfulness. The unreliability of memory, an abiding Stoppardian concern, is briefly flirted with in the final scene. But ultimately, memory isn't the capricious, fragmenting prism of classic Stoppard. Here, recollection is a laser, a tool to be focused on a past teeming with harsh and essential lessons for the present. It seems fitting that, for once in a Stoppard work, words aren't what leave the most lasting impression. It is instead the vision of people frozen as if for a photograph, beckoning with poignantly immediate life from a distant time before they dissolve into anonymous darkness. ""Leopoldstadt"" demands, with gravity and eloquence, that we never let those visions disappear.","In what he says will probably be his last work, a master playwright finds urgent lessons for the present in the past of a Viennese family.",da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/12/arts/leopoldstatd-review1/leopoldstatd-review1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=c8831ab05098bd9921d78c1bcff4a65dcd044efe7f61310de2beb700adefef4b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Adrian Scarborough, left, and Luke Thallon in Tom Stoppard's ""Leopoldstadt"" at Wyndham's Theater in London.",da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc.jpg,10
Food,"A Savory, Tender Gnocchi Poised for Success",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/dining/ricotta-gnocchi-dumpling-recipe.html,"Gnocchi, those savory little dumplings, are frequently offered as a first course in Italian restaurants, as an alternative to a pasta course. Other times, a larger portion may make a fine hot lunch, or just a few gnocchi can round out a main course, sidled up to a saucy braised veal shank. The secret to making magnificent tender gnocchi at home is the same as the old joke about how to get to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice.

This is especially true with potato gnocchi; a beginner's attempts usually produce tough, chewy specimens. Overhandled dough and too much added flour may be the culprits, but in truth, there is a learning curve. Expertise is achieved only by repetition, until you acquire the feel for it.

There are, however, many other kinds of traditional Italian gnocchi that don't use potatoes at all. Gnocchi alla romana, for example, is a golden, crisp-topped baked dish made with slices of cooked semolina splashed with cream, butter and cheese. That kind is easier to execute.

And most home cooks can find success making ricotta gnocchi, which, when at their best, can be exceedingly light and delicate (and still pretty darned good even when they're not completely perfect). Essentially, they are made from ricotta and eggs, a touch of Parmesan and a handful of flour. Good, fresh ricotta is critical. Use the very best you can find, typically available at any good Italian deli or well-stocked cheese shops. (The grainy low-fat commercial type doesn't qualify here.) Drain your ricotta well before making the recipe, or the dough will be too wet. Put it in a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl, for several hours or overnight. You will be surprised by how much liquid whey seeps out. I sometimes drink a glass of it (it makes a pleasant beverage and is known to be highly nutritious) or save it to use in soups or smoothies.

When mixing the dough for ricotta gnocchi -- it's really more like a stiff batter -- add the least amount of flour possible. The ethereal custardy ricotta gnocchi served at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco have no flour at all, and the dough must be dropped by the spoonful into simmering water. Those are the lightest ricotta dumplings I know.

But I learned in Italy that adding a small amount ( 1/4  to  1/2  cup) of all-purpose flour to the dough and using fine semolina flour for dusting the work surface makes it possible to roll the dough into long ropes. Use scissors to snip the ropes into gnocchi shapes. I like to let the shaped gnocchi rest on a semolina-dusted baking sheet for an hour before cooking them, but it's fine to skip that step. Ricotta gnocchi are wonderful served in broth or with a light tomato sauce. Another classic preparation has them swimming in butter with sage leaves. But my latest favorite version is to sauce them with a simple parsley pesto, and to finish with a shower of chopped pistachios and Parmesan. These feathery dumplings, with the herbal tang of parsley pesto, call for a penetrating white wine that will cut through their richness but won't be too sharp. The options are many. Fianos from Campania would be delicious, as would good Soaves. If you can find a decent vernaccia di San Gimignano, that would be fine. French wines would be terrific, particularly aligotes from Burgundy and Muscadets from the Atlantic. Vermentinos from Liguria or Corsica would also work well.

Media,Donald Trump Elicits Shock and Biting Satire in European Media,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/business/media/donald-trump-elicits-shock-and-biting-satire-in-europe.html,"LONDON -- He has been depicted as a snarling demagogue in France, equated with Donald Duck in Spain, and described as worse than Lord Voldemort in Britain. In Europe, the birthplace of the Enlightenment, Donald Trump has been treated variously as a disturbing curiosity or an entertaining political show barker. His nearly every move and pronouncement has been reported from Paris to Berlin to Helsinki, even as commentators on both left and right have dismissed the notion of President Donald J. Trump as the stuff of fantasy, or, at worst, a momentary lapse of reason. That is changing. With a series of wins in key Republican primary states, and with the billionaire's expected strong showing when 12 states hold primaries or caucuses on Tuesday, the European media, like its American counterpart, is adjusting to the prospect of a seemingly unstoppable Trump juggernaut. The reaction is a mix of befuddlement, outrage and panic, along with admiration in some unlikely quarters. And satire. The Spanish newspaper El Pais recently published an imaginary letter from the grave in which Philip II, a 16th-century Spanish king who ruled a vast empire, offers advice to Mr. Trump. Noting that his nation had also suffered from roguish subjects demanding free handouts, and Muslim terrorists masquerading as peaceful citizens, the king advises Mr. Trump to ""consider bringing back the Inquisition.""

Mr. Trump's often scowling face appears frequently on front pages, his success parsed daily on news bulletins and radio talk shows. Coverage tends to focus on his more outrageous statements rather than much serious examination of how a Trump presidency -- still regarded with horror by many -- might affect international diplomacy. Hillary Clinton's name recognition and star power still fascinate, as does the surprising ascent of her Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders. But Mr. Trump is stealing most of the headlines. Jakob Nielsen, the online editor and former Washington bureau chief of Politiken, an influential Danish newspaper, said that initially editors there did not take Mr. Trump's candidacy seriously, and were disbelieving when the paper's United States correspondents started filing articles saying he might win the Republican nomination. ""As Trump has risen and as he has won the first primaries, the coverage has gone from fascination to outrage,"" he said in a phone interview from Copenhagen. ""There is a sense of shock here after we have seen Trump rallies with almost fascistlike rhetoric."" Reflecting that disbelief, a cartoon in Politiken last week showed a couple on a sofa watching a CNN report asking ""Will Trump make it all the way?"" The incredulous husband tells his wife: ""This is too unreal. Can we watch something more realistic like 'Star Wars'?""

Mr. Trump's toxic irreverence has helped fan the criticism. He drew the ire of the press -- and officials in London and Paris -- after he described neighborhoods in their cities as no-go zones for police. In Britain, his widely reported comments that foreign Muslims should not be allowed to enter the United States provoked such outrage that members of Parliament debated a petition, signed by more than 580,000 people, to ban him from entering the country. (He can still visit.)

A commentary in Bild, a populist German tabloid, recently noted that most Germans could not say who was running in the German state elections in March, but they were following the election campaign in ""distant"" America. For all the provocations by Mr. Trump, his deftness at tapping into the visceral anger of Americans shaken by economic doldrums and globalization has deep resonance in Europe, where citizens from Britain to France to Hungary have also turned to insurgent politicians on the far right or the far left to express disgust with the political mainstream. Jaroslav Plesl, the editor of Mlada fronta Dnes, a leading Czech newspaper, said in an interview that Mr. Trump's willingness to take on the political establishment, even in his own party, had made him a folk hero of sorts in Eastern and Central Europe among people who were disillusioned with the post-1989 political order. Equating Mr. Trump's appeal to that of Ronald Reagan, he argued that the candidate was drawing in fans with his showmanship and swagger. ""The elites in Prague will sneer at him for being dumb and a bad role model, but Czechs in general like underdogs and outsiders like Trump,"" he said. ""To many young people who worship American popular culture, Trump signifies American values like show business, and working hard to achieve success.""

Others in the European news media, however, have expressed shock at Mr. Trump's brand of incendiary politics, in particular the insults he has lobbed at minorities, Muslims, Mexicans, women and the handicapped. Europe has its own brand of immigrant-baiting far-right figures, from Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France to Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party. Mr. Trump enjoys greater popularity in Russia, where the budding bromance between the American and President Vladimir V. Putin has won him praise. The news channel Russia Today, or RT, paid homage to Mr. Trump's talents as a shock jock, and published an interactive article ""on the top ways to be offensive -- Trump-style."" Among the insults highlighted was Mr. Trump's off-color attack on the former Representative Barney Frank, referring to what Mr. Trump called his ""protruding nipples."" ""Love him or hate him, the Republican has an uncanny ability to elicit an explosive response whenever he gets near a keyboard,"" said the broadcaster, which is funded by the Kremlin. Adding to Mr. Trump's fans in Europe, Ms. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the National Front, wrote on Twitter on Saturday: ""If I were American, I'd vote Donald Trump ... but God bless him!"" Mr. Le Pen, 87, has been convicted several times of inciting racial hatred. By contrast, the left-leaning French newspaper Liberation expressed puzzlement at Mr. Trump's ascent. Under the headline ""Trump, From Nightmare to Reality,"" it recently noted that there appeared to be nothing to stop Mr. Trump from winning the Republican nomination. ""And this, despite his thundering racist and sexist declarations.""","Once dismissive of Mr. Trump's presidential candidacy, European news media are adjusting to the prospect of a seemingly unstoppable Trump juggernaut.",ed504d2e-939b-5641-b3a8-75175bc7efc3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/29/business/29eutrump-web1/29eutrump-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=11de68352e974a4879ccdd5b5545a74e73a7108a75eab1bb45f02836c28d03d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"On a recent issue of Der Spiegel, the headline says ""Madness: America's Agitator Donald Trump.""",ed504d2e-939b-5641-b3a8-75175bc7efc3,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/ed504d2e-939b-5641-b3a8-75175bc7efc3.jpg,16
Technology,"Apple, Google and a Deal That Controls the Internet",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/technology/apple-google-search-antitrust.html,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- When Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Apple and Google, were photographed eating dinner together in 2017 at an upscale Vietnamese restaurant called Tamarine, the picture set off a tabloid-worthy frenzy about the relationship between the two most powerful companies in Silicon Valley. As the two men sipped red wine at a window table inside the restaurant in Palo Alto, their companies were in tense negotiations to renew one of the most lucrative business deals in history: an agreement to feature Google's search engine as the preselected choice on Apple's iPhone and other devices. The updated deal was worth billions of dollars to both companies and cemented their status at the top of the tech industry's pecking order. Now, the partnership is in jeopardy. Last Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit against Google -- the U.S. government's biggest antitrust case in two decades -- and homed in on the alliance as a prime example of what prosecutors say are the company's illegal tactics to protect its monopoly and choke off competition in web search.

""We have this sort of strange term in Silicon Valley: co-opetition,"" said Bruce Sewell, Apple's general counsel from 2009 to 2017. ""You have brutal competition, but at the same time, you have necessary cooperation."" Apple and Google are joined at the hip even though Mr. Cook has said internet advertising, Google's bread and butter, engages in ""surveillance"" of consumers and even though Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, once promised ""thermonuclear war"" on his Silicon Valley neighbor when he learned it was working on a rival to the iPhone. Apple and Google's parent company, Alphabet, worth more than $3 trillion combined, do compete on plenty of fronts, like smartphones, digital maps and laptops. But they also know how to make nice when it suits their interests. And few deals have been nicer to both sides of the table than the iPhone search deal. Nearly half of Google's search traffic now comes from Apple devices, according to the Justice Department, and the prospect of losing the Apple deal has been described as a ""code red"" scenario inside the company. When iPhone users search on Google, they see the search ads that drive Google's business. They can also find their way to other Google products, like YouTube.

A former Google executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not permitted to talk about the deal, said the prospect of losing Apple's traffic was ""terrifying"" to the company. The Justice Department, which is asking for a court injunction preventing Google from entering into deals like the one it made with Apple, argues that the arrangement has unfairly helped make Google, which handles 92 percent of the world's internet searches, the center of consumers' online lives. Online businesses like Yelp and Expedia, as well as companies ranging from noodle shops to news organizations, often complain that Google's search domination enables it to charge advertising fees when people simply look up their names, as well as to steer consumers toward its own products, like Google Maps. Microsoft, which had its own antitrust battle two decades ago, has told British regulators that if it were the default option on iPhones and iPads, it would make more advertising money for every search on its rival search engine, Bing. What's more, competitors like DuckDuckGo, a small search engine that sells itself as a privacy-focused alternative to Google, could never match Google's tab with Apple. Apple now receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments -- up from $1 billion a year in 2014 -- in exchange for building Google's search engine into its products. It is probably the single biggest payment that Google makes to anyone and accounts for 14 to 21 percent of Apple's annual profits. That's not money Apple would be eager to walk away from. In fact, Mr. Cook and Mr. Pichai met again in 2018 to discuss how they could increase revenue from search. After the meeting, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart that ""our vision is that we work as if we are one company,"" according to the Justice Department's complaint. A forced breakup could mean the loss of easy money to Apple. But it would be a more significant threat to Google, which would have no obvious way to replace the lost traffic. It could also push Apple to acquire or build its own search engine. Within Google, people believe that Apple is one of the few companies in the world that could offer a formidable alternative, according to one former executive. Google has also worried that without the agreement, Apple could make it more difficult for iPhone users to get to the Google search engine.

A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the partnership, while a Google spokesman pointed to a blog post in which the company defended the relationship. Even though its bill with Apple keeps going up, Google has said again and again that it dominates internet search because consumers prefer it, not because it is buying customers. The company argues that the Justice Department is painting an incomplete picture; its partnership with Apple, it says, is no different than Coca-Cola paying a supermarket for prominent shelf space. Other search engines like Microsoft's Bing also have revenue-sharing agreements with Apple to appear as secondary search options on iPhones, Google says in its defense. It adds that Apple allows people to change their default search engine from Google -- though few probably do because people typically don't tinker with such settings and many prefer Google anyway. Apple has rarely, if ever, publicly acknowledged its deal with Google, and according to Bernstein Research, has mentioned its so-called licensing revenue in an earnings call for the first time this year. According to a former senior executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality contracts, Apple's leaders have made the same calculation about Google as much of the general public: The utility of its search engine is worth the cost of its invasive practices. ""Their search engine is the best,"" Mr. Cook said when asked by Axios in late 2018 why he partnered with a company he also implicitly criticized. He added that Apple had also created ways to blunt Google's collection of data, such as a private-browsing mode on Apple's internet browser. The deal is not limited to searches in Apple's Safari browser; it extends to virtually all searches done on Apple devices, including with Apple's virtual assistant, Siri, and on Google's iPhone app and Chrome browser.

In 2005, Apple and Google inked what at the time seemed like a modest deal: Google would be the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser on Mac computers. Quickly, Mr. Cook, then still a deputy to Mr. Jobs, saw the arrangement's lucrative potential, according to another former senior Apple executive who asked not to be named. Google's payments were pure profit, and all Apple had to do was feature a search engine its users already wanted. Apple expanded the deal for its big upcoming product: the iPhone. When Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone in 2007, he invited Eric Schmidt, Google's then chief executive, to join him onstage for the first of Apple's many famous iPhone events. ""If we just sort of merged the two companies, we could just call them AppleGoo,"" joked Mr. Schmidt, who was also on Apple's board of directors. With Google search on the iPhone, he added, ""you can actually merge without merging."" Then the relationship soured. Google had quietly been developing a competitor to the iPhone: smartphone software called Android that any phone maker could use. Mr. Jobs was furious. In 2010, Apple sued a phone maker that used Android. ""I'm going to destroy Android,"" Mr. Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. ""I will spend my last dying breath if I need to.""","In a landmark antitrust complaint, the Justice Department is targeting a secretive partnership that is worth billions of dollars to both companies.",da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/25/business/25applegoogle/merlin_16520613_782fdb1d-b33b-4d7e-8b5c-43c961e3df14-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7eeeb1e05ded3884ff66f030bf45efa17872d3d6647566bb0942f98bd5426c42&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In 2007, Steve Jobs, left, Apple's co-founder, invited Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, to join him to explain how Google would work on the iPhone.",da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95.jpg,20

A planet's magnetic field is generated by the flow of liquid iron deep in its core. While Earth's magnetic field helps shield life here from solar radiation, Mercury is unlikely to be harboring inhabitants that need protection.

Still, the information is useful because it ""is dating processes in the interior of the planet, and it basically tells us something about Mercury's past,"" said Catherine Johnson, a geophysicist at the University of British Columbia and an author of the new study, published in the journal Science.","The spacecraft, which orbited Mercury for four years before crashing into it, found that its magnetic field is almost as old as the planet itself.",2599ad7d-65f6-547b-873e-555c7527fe03,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/12/science/12OBSERVATORY/12OBSERVATORY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=a9b86b8e93b8c541a6f209f13ded1ac5a3b685211e8ec95e51b1341e3704a9bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,NASA's Messenger spacecraft found useful information about Mercury's magnetic field before it crashed into the planet.,2599ad7d-65f6-547b-873e-555c7527fe03,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/2599ad7d-65f6-547b-873e-555c7527fe03.jpg,2
Automobiles,A Truck Tailgate Party: Fire Up the Grilles,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/automobiles/tailgate-party-fire-up-the-grilles.html,"The look of its pickup trucks is so important that General Motors put its best man on the job: the guy who does the Corvettes. Fresh from the task of designing the 2014 Stingray, Tom Peters took on the task of freshening up -- and toughening up -- the Chevrolet Silverado and its fraternal twin, the GMC Sierra. ""A fist in the wind"" is how Mr. Peters describes the pickups' design. The new G.M. trucks are not alone in looking as if they can deliver a punch. The latest full-size pickups from G.M.'s crosstown rivals, Ford and Ram, step into the ring with flattened noses, their huge, blunt grilles often slathered in bright trim. A special edition of the latest Toyota Tundra seems to have as many bars as Milwaukee, capped with a flat, wide nostril. ""There is a trend toward a bigger, bolder look,"" said Mr. Peters, the director of exterior design for Chevrolet trucks, full-size crossovers and performance cars. Automobile grilles have long been carefully created to reflect the image of their brands and a particular model's place in the hierarchy, while truck grilles were comparatively bare and basic. But with trucks locked in ever-fiercer sales battles, their grilles have grown larger and more eye-catching, a modern, motorized riff on the battle shields of medieval crusaders.

After taking a hit when the economy slumped, pickup sales are on the rise again on the strength of a rebounding construction industry: Ram (previously known as Dodge Trucks) gained 49 percent in April from a year earlier, and the full-size truck sales of G.M. and Ford each rose around 24 percent. Manufacturers are scrambling to grab larger shares of this highly profitable market with tougher, more distinctive designs. Rugged exteriors help to hide the fact that many of today's macho-looking trucks are softies on the inside, with interiors wrapped in soft leather, decked with wood trim and buzzing with electronic gadgets. Luxury trucks are especially hot. Ford says that about a third of its pickup sales come from the higher-end versions priced at $35,000 or more. Not long ago, a $50,000 pickup seemed unimaginable. Now the price tags on fancy trucks can rise well above $60,000. In addition, a tough grille can obscure the fact that the power plant behind it is shrinking -- with more fuel-efficient V-6 engines replacing thirsty V-8s in many pickup trucks.

In Texas, where one-sixth of the nation's pickups are sold, and where Mr. Peters showed off his new truck to the press recently, pickups are like the standard uniform of boots and cowboy hats: they are everywhere, but they come in many styles and shapes. Greater personalization, with a variety of available faces, is the latest truck trend. The image of the pickup truck is firmly wrapped in American mythology. Model names read like the listings for John Wayne Week on the Turner Classic Movies channel: High Country, King Ranch, Laramie Longhorn. Manufacturers present trucks primarily as work tools, but despite the ads featuring cowboys, farmers and construction workers, more and more trucks are being used partly -- or mostly -- as family vehicles. ""There's a lot of diversity in the customer range,"" said Joe Dehner, chief exterior designer for Ram and Dodge. In addition to working trucks, he said, ""we also get the 'air haulers,' which means they don't necessarily carry something."" For decades, trucks looked like basic metal boxes. Then Dodge offered up a bold new look for its Ram for the 1994 model year. Under Tom Gale, then the design chief for Chrysler, the pickup added a touch of fantasy to the utilitarian box. With its arched grille and raised hood, the Ram resembled the cab of a mighty 18-wheeler. Today's Ram designers call it ""the big-rig look,"" said Mr. Dehner. ""We own that."" But pickups from other manufacturers began to show the Ram's influence as their designers visually separated the hood and fenders and raised the grille above the headlights.

The perennial best-selling pickup, the Ford F-150, was last redesigned for 2009. But today's F-150 wears many faces: depending on the model or trim level, the grille has multiple small bars or large planks of chrome along with different shapes and colors of meshlike patterns. The Atlas concept truck, unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show, appears to borrow the muscular look of Ford's Super Duty line of larger, more powerful pickups. The Atlas is believed to foreshadow the design of the next-generation F-150, expected next year. The face of the Atlas adds vertical elements to the horizontal bars of the current F-150. The grille's frame forms a shape that suggests the nostrils of a bull. Toyota's new design for its big Tundra truck, first displayed at the Chicago auto show in February, was devised at the Calty design studio in California. The Tundra's grille frame has also been enlarged and its designers, too, use words like bold, chiseled and tough. In one sign of how much truck grilles have grown, the Nissan Titan's, which seemed notably aggressive when the truck made its debut as a 2004 model, looks relatively undersized in comparison with the newer designs of its rivals. Grilles play a critical role in differentiating the many submodels and trim levels of today's trucks. ""It is almost mind-boggling how complex the choices have become,"" Mr. Peters said.

Ford offers a huge choice of variants with its F-150, visually distinguishing a range from base models to King Ranch and Harley-Davidson editions, Special and Platinum luxury versions and the high-performance SVT Raptor, with huge letters molded into a black front end that Ford calls a ""brick wall grille."" Mr. Dehner, the Ram designer, said: ""There has been an explosion of different textures and finishes, not just in the grilles but with colors, wheels and trim packages. People want their vehicle to be customizable. It goes from the country to the urban cowboy and, if you will, the city slicker type. We want to be specific to their needs."" The Ram 1500 comes in nine trim levels and offers four basic types of grille mesh. There is a ""hex-link"" design on the Tradesman, Express and SLT models, with six-sided cells that provide ""the metaphor of the bolt head,"" Mr. Dehner said. The upscale Laramie has a similar ""hex-perf"" grille, in chrome. Then there are two versions of ""billet-perf"" on the Big Horn and Sport. ""It goes with a monochromatic look, big wheels, a hot-rod look,"" he said. The top-of-the-line Laramie Longhorn offers ""wave-mesh"" texture, a diamond wire pattern that dates to sports cars of the 1920s. ""It is an adaptation of the wire mesh grilles on upscale sport utilities,"" Mr. Dehner said. Aerodynamics, surprisingly, may be behind some of the rugged, angular faces of trucks. As boxy as they look, all the trucks are carefully tested in wind tunnels. The fist in the wind must be streamlined: Chevrolet says it has cut aerodynamic drag by 5 percent from the previous Silverado.

Books,Are Ben Marcus's Dark and Disturbing New Stories the Literary Answer to 'Black Mirror'?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/books/review/ben-marcus-notes-from-the-fog.html,"'s new collection of stories takes a dark view of society, as well as of love, sex, marriage, parenting, employment, technology and human interaction of any kind. He's an engrossing, poetically surreal writer. He's often woundingly funny. Still, the pages turn more heavily here than they did in his last two books, ""Leaving the Sea"" (2014) and ""The Flame Alphabet"" (2012) -- which, by the way, were not exactly Disney on Ice.

This is not to say that Marcus is wrong about people, or about the creepy ""Black Mirror"" episode that's become our lives. There's a small, raw moment in the beautifully unnerving opening story, ""Cold Little Bird,"" that distills the book's cautionary howl. A 10-year-old named Jonah has made a chilling announcement to his parents: He no longer loves them or requires their oversight and, if they so much as hug him, he'll report them to the school therapist for unwanted touching. Jonah's father, Martin, is terrified -- both for his boy and himself. Like virtually every couple in the book, he and his wife are post-passion and nearly post-verbal. ""You'll die, without affection,"" Martin tells his son. ""I'm not kidding. You will actually dry up and die."" ""Notes From the Fog"" is about people so alienated that they're not so much living together as standing on adjacent ice floes.

There was a time when the words ""dystopian"" and ""futuristic"" were nearly synonyms, but even the most alarming events in Marcus's genre-roaming book seem no more than five minutes from now. In ""The Grow-Light Blues,"" Carl Hirsch's craven employers choose him to test a product that would replace meals with nutrient-infused rays from a laptop. The admiration and gratitude of his co-workers fade quickly and the light that's ""slowly roasting Carl's face"" transforms him into a monster to be pitied, shunned, fired. In ""Precious Precious,"" a cubicle worker named Ida Grieve is prescribed an insane-sounding antidepressant, called Rally, which is nearly impossible to swallow, then sits undigested in her stomach like a bomb waiting to go off: ""Soon it had risen back into her mouth -- it felt like a small insect crawling up her throat -- and she had to take it out and butter it again."" All the while, Ida is visiting her aging parents as their minds decay. When her mother fears that she's talking gibberish, she takes Ida's hand and -- in another tiny exchange that evokes a larger quest for connection -- says urgently, ""I made sense, didn't I? ... I want to. I so want to. You know that, right?""","""Notes From the Fog"" features the author's trademark humor and a vision of society both devastatingly bleak and seemingly plausible.",e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/02/books/review/02Giles1/02Giles1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=146708f2b527730a1bf0fbc30c889127a8097294a617b816995b14c9b07d98bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ben Marcus,e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb.jpg,13
Books,"For Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Nearly 100, the Beat Goes On",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/books/review/lawrence-ferlinghetti-greatest-poems.html,"Yeah, O.K. -- but what about his writing? The release of ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Poems"" (I wish New Directions had gone ahead and called it ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Hits,"" like an album full of ear candy by Tom Petty or Elton John) gives us a chance to revisit that question. It's a complicated one. Do the quicksilver qualities that can make Ferlinghetti's poetry so captivating to an adolescent undermine our ability to take it seriously with the passing of years? In his more unfortunate moments, as in the poem called ""Underwear,"" corny humor lands with a clank and you can't help wincing: ""Underwear can really get you in a bind / Negroes often wear / white underwear / which may lead to trouble.""

It seems self-evident that the passing of years has done ""Underwear"" no favors. At the same time, it would be churlish to deny that Ferlinghetti has given the popular canon many indelible lines. For a while in the 1950s and 1960s, his voice stood out amid a mounting dissident chorus; in these days of hashtagged political resistance, it is not uncommon to come across portions of his stanzas reconstituted as memes on Instagram and Facebook:

Based on passages like that, it's not much of a stretch to put Ferlinghetti in the company of skilled songwriters. He knows how to craft a hook. His lines have an easy, welcoming flow. (In this book, the poems are arranged chronologically and fluidly, as if they were part of an ""Abbey Road""-like symphonic collage or a Hollywood highlight reel.) He has a gift for helping you hear what needs to be said, free of impenetrable filters. He is allergic to willful obscurity and ""our little literary games,"" as he declared in one ""Howl""-referencing populist manifesto that he titled, with characteristic directness, ""Populist Manifesto No. 1"":

Returning to Ferlinghetti is ultimately about returning to the romantic associations of the milieu that produced Ferlinghetti, so it makes sense that some of Ferlinghetti's most plangent stanzas are the ones in which he looks back at the heyday of the Beats, that ""rebel band who / rose over the rooftops of / tenement boneyards / intent on making out / And made out of madness / a hundred years of beatitude."" Maybe there's no way to dissociate Ferlinghetti's poetry from the nostalgic gauze of various North Beach beatnik tropes -- proto-hipsters wearing berets and listening to bebop and smoking French cigarettes, etc. -- but what remains intact in the poems (even as their creator approaches a century of living) is the fresh, youthful energy of that moment. The liberating pulse can still be pretty contagious. His high points are the poems that you wish you could listen to in a car, on a long coastal highway, with the windows rolled down -- and you certainly can't say that about Robert Lowell.

Does the occasionally tossed-off imperfection of the poems give them a kind of time-capsuled charm? If you're willing as a reader to be forgiving, it can be a blast to go back to the way the words bounce. And Ferlinghetti himself can't resist the pull of the past. In ""Plan du Centre de Paris a Vol d'Oiseau,"" this is how he remembers it:","A retrospective collection from the poet and publisher, ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Poems,"" gets at his rebellious appeal.",2dfd7573-6629-523b-8c0c-7d0b532a17f0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/18/books/review/18Gordinier/18Gordinier-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0c6f34724075361e65d9bc44de5aa0b5185474f3e6eb416fe4d8a946d86f6f2c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lawrence Ferlinghetti, left, at a poetry reading.",2dfd7573-6629-523b-8c0c-7d0b532a17f0,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/2dfd7573-6629-523b-8c0c-7d0b532a17f0.jpg,13
Your Money,Are Markets Efficient? Even the Supreme Court Is Weighing In,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/your-money/are-markets-efficient-even-the-supreme-court-is-weighing-in.html,"A fierce debate about an academic theory loomed over the Nobel in economic science for 2013. Last week, the Supreme Court enshrined that argument in jurisprudence, issuing a ruling that is likely to make it harder for investors to prevail in some big class-action lawsuits. The court's decision emerges from a debate that has been simmering among economists for decades. It flared up again last fall, after the Nobel committee announced that it was giving the 2013 prize to three economists with discordant views on a wonky notion known as the efficient-markets hypothesis. Its core tenet is that market prices embody all available information. That may seem a simple thought, but its implications are controversial, and the court's position has important repercussions. The court delved into this arcane issue during a busy week in which it issued a series of major decisions dealing with cellphone privacy, presidential recess appointments and broadcasters' copyrights in a dispute involving Aereo, the upstart television streaming service. It turned to the efficient-markets hypothesis in a case concerning asbestos liabilities of the oil services company Halliburton. The court rejected a broad challenge to class-action lawsuits contending securities fraud. But it added a major new hurdle for investors that could stop some class-action suits in their tracks by letting corporate defendants try to prove, at an early stage, that there was no connection at all between corporate misstatements and share prices -- and therefore no grounds for litigation.

The court justified this change by updating its notion of market efficiency, basing its interpretation partly on the views of Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist and a 2013 Nobel laureate. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. echoed Mr. Shiller when he said market prices usually reflect what's known about publicly traded companies -- but not always. In other words, the court said that while market prices contain a great deal of information, they are highly imperfect. The court used that distinction to make an important change in the class-action arena. From now on, companies facing class actions can try to show at an early stage that even if they've made misstatements, market prices were not affected. Until now, the courts had held that the efficient-markets hypothesis meant that such public statements automatically affected market prices, John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia law professor, said in an interview. ""The court ruling could make it easier for companies to get cases dismissed at an early stage,"" he said. ""And it is likely to make it much more expensive for plaintiffs -- for investors -- to file suit."" The argument about efficient markets re-emerged in October, when Mr. Shiller, along with Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, both of the University of Chicago, won the Nobel. The Nobel committee initially finessed the economists' disagreements by citing their collective contributions to ""empirical analysis of asset prices."" But the divergent opinions among the economists are deep-seated, and Mr. Shiller addressed them last October in an Economic View column in The New York Times; Justice Roberts cited the column in his decision. Mr. Shiller wrote: ""Professor Fama is known as the father of the modern efficient-markets theory, which says financial prices efficiently incorporate all available information and are in that sense perfect. In contrast, I have argued that the theory makes little sense, except in fairly trivial ways.""

Mr. Shiller emphasized ""the enormous role of human error"" that has been documented by behavioral finance and the need to rein in market excesses through regulation. (In an interview, Mr. Fama expressed skepticism about Mr. Shiller's emphasis on the irrational, and said that while he preferred market solutions, regulatory action was often needed.) In court filings and oral arguments, Halliburton said debates like this demonstrated that economists no longer accept the efficient-markets hypothesis as gospel. Therefore, the company argued, the court should overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, that has allowed shareholders in publicly traded companies to form class-action groups based on the automatic assumption that significant misstatements caused share prices to fall. ""The economics have changed,"" Aaron M. Streett, Halliburton's lawyer, declared before the court. He said that many investors ""do not rely on the integrity of the market price whatsoever."" In the Supreme Court's decision, which sends the Halliburton case back to a lower court, Justice Roberts rejected these claims, quoting Mr. Shiller's column. It said: ""Of course, prices reflect available information."" Yet the court also accepted that market prices reflect information imperfectly at best, as Mr. Shiller and others have argued. Sometimes, for example, prices are much higher than can be justified by fundamental factors like corporate earnings and other public information. Sometimes, the court suggested, investors may have disregarded major misstatements by companies' executives. So the court occupied something of a middle ground, much as the Nobel committee did. Investors may continue to rely on the efficient-markets hypothesis in forming class-action groups, and may assume that share prices reflect corporate misstatements. But corporate defendants may now try to prove in specific cases that there was no connection between their statements and price movements. ""It's death by 1,000 cuts,"" Professor Coffee said. ""This isn't in itself a devastating blow to class-action plaintiffs. But it hurts, and it follows a number of other decisions that have limited plaintiffs' ability to sue successfully.""

It could have been much worse for plaintiffs, he observed. A concurring but critical opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas and endorsed by Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Antonin Scalia, came down firmly on Halliburton's side. They said the economic profession's critique of the efficient-markets hypothesis has been so devastating that the precedent set by the Basic v. Levinson case should be overturned entirely. But the court as a whole approached efficient markets much as many long-term investors do. For many practical purposes, it's reasonable to assume that markets are efficient. That's why it's so hard to outperform them, and why so many people use low-cost index funds as their core portfolio holdings. Yet, in another sense, markets aren't efficient at all. They are prone to bouts of irrational exuberance, outright panic and other apparent aberrations that give wise traders an edge, and make claims of total efficiency hard to defend. Are markets efficient? It's all in the details, the court seemed to say. Often they are, but sometimes they're not, and investors need to prepare for the consequences.","In a case that delved into a much-debated academic theory, a ruling erects a new hurdle for investors to clear in some class-action lawsuits.",2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/business/29-STRA/29-STRA-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=431&w=600&s=1237f36c9a32bbf5b94027634104fc59dff225ce4ab778cbe21201d340e179ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The court's order was brief, provisional and unsigned, but it drew a furious dissent from the three female justices.",2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369.jpg,21
Art & Design,Amos Rex Museum Is Helsinki's New Homegrown Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/arts/design/amos-rex-museum-is-helsinkis-new-homegrown-star.html,"HELSINKI, Finland -- The novelist Meg Wolitzer once wrote that Helsinki is ""a place no one ever thinks about unless they're listening to Sibelius, or lying on the hot, wet slats of a sauna, or eating a bowl of reindeer."" The city leadership here is keen to add something new to that list: fine art. Amos Rex, a new contemporary art museum, goes a long way toward achieving that goal. A museum that appears to physically resist its placement in a vast underground space, it is topped by five conical domes that bubble up from the surface of the Lasipalatsi Square in downtown Helsinki like inverted craters of an alien moonscape. Children clamber up the mounds, teenagers skateboard down its slopes, and passers-by snap selfies.

The $58 million privately funded museum arrives less than two years after Helsinki's City Council rejected a plan to build a $138 million Guggenheim museum along the city's harbor. City officials as well as residents were deeply, often rancorously, divided about the proposal, with supporters asserting that the Guggenheim would raise the city's international profile and serve as an economic game-changer, while opponents said local resources were better spent on cultural institutions that showcased Finnish talent. Finland, after all, has a proud tradition of design exemplified by the architect Alvar Aalto, the designers Timo Sarpaneva and Tapio Wirkkala and, yes, Marimekko. After the five-year controversy dissipated, Mayor Jan Vapaavuori of Helsinki said, everyone took a step back to reconsider the city's cultural priorities.

""What the Guggenheim process led to was a quite serious reflection among all important art players in the city, where they were forced to assess their own place and role in today's world,"" Mayor Vapaavuori said in an interview. ""The positive side of the discussion is that we have a more comprehensive understanding of what culture and art does for the city. It could be that without the Guggenheim discussion we would not be that far along.""

In many ways, Amos Rex vindicates the city's decision to turn down the Guggenheim project, and instead champion a homegrown Finnish institution. The new contemporary art museum is funded by private money, whereas the Guggenheim was designed as a public-private partnership, which some artists feared would sap funding for local arts initiatives. Mr. Kartio, who said he would have welcomed the Guggenheim, notes that planning for Amos Rex was already underway when the Guggenheim project fell apart. However, he added, ""The timing was fortunate for us because of course politically, internally in Finland, we were compared to Guggenheim all the time. Since this was completely privately financed and homegrown, people were very fond of us, especially the people who weren't in favor of the Guggenheim."" The money to build the new museum came from a foundation established by the museum's Finnish founder, Amos Anderson, a newspaper publisher and a patron of the arts, who died in 1961 and earmarked his fortune for the building of the Amos Anderson Art Museum. Four years after he died, the museum opened in his own home in Helsinki with a collection of mostly Finnish and other European art.

Seeking to build a new larger home, Amos Anderson museum and its officials chose the Lasipalatsi, or glass palace, a landmark of Finnish functionalist architecture that houses an entertainment and shopping center with an Art Deco cinema called Bio Rex. Designed by architecture students in 1936 as a temporary site for the Olympics (scheduled to take place in Helsinki in 1940 but postponed until 1952 because of World War II), the Lasipalatsi was supposed to be torn down afterward, but remained, and became a cherished national landmark. The private Amos Rex Foundation formed a real estate company with the city of Helsinki to jointly own the old entertainment complex, and to build a new museum, which it owns independently. The foundation leases the land on which both buildings sit from the city. To build the museum while preserving the existing building, the architects came up with an ingenious idea to excavate the central plaza and create 24,000 square feet of exhibition space. Below the exhibition halls, two stories down, are archive and storage rooms. Amos Rex, which derives its name from the museum's founder and the cinema, has helped create a kind of ""museum mile"" that joins up with the three of the city's nearby art institutions -- Kiasma Contemporary Art Museum, the Helsinki Art Museum and Kunsthalle Helsinki. ""It's one big cluster, and we bind it together in a way, and we all support each other,"" Mr. Kartio said.

The results of Helsinki's post-Guggenheim rethink are manifest throughout the city: A few blocks away from the new museum, the Helsinki Central Library Oodi is under construction and expected to open in December. The Helsinki Art Museum is organizing an International Helsinki Art Biennial to open in 2020 and two weeks ago, the city announced its intention to build a world-class architecture and design museum in the harborside space that the Guggenheim might have occupied. ""A lot of exciting things are happening right now in Helsinki,"" said Raija Koli, director of Frame Contemporary Art of Finland, which provides grants to Finnish artists and coordinates Finland's participation in the Venice Biennale. ""We're regrouping and I think in a good way. There's a lot of good will from everyone to kind of bring their resources together and that's why it's such a great time to be working with art and culture here right now.""",A new contemporary art museum vindicates the Finnish capital's decision to turn down a proposal to build a Guggenheim branch there.,5150d5c3-2c60-5ba4-b6f9-eb061cc8ac6d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/08/arts/08amosrex1/08amosrex1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bf070a03912601c84708b90fc6483d9c785ff161b1c147a1103f3ec5709d0746&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Visitors outside Amos Rex, an underground museum topped by conical domes that bubble up from the surface of the Lasipalatsi Square in downtown Helsinki.",5150d5c3-2c60-5ba4-b6f9-eb061cc8ac6d,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/5150d5c3-2c60-5ba4-b6f9-eb061cc8ac6d.jpg,14
Theater,"Stars Bring a Broadway Tune Back to Times Square, Unexpectedly",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/theater/surprise-theater-times-square.html,"Broadway performers sing their hearts out under face shields Wednesday at a pop-up event on the TKTS stairs in Times Square.





The first notes of the unexpected chorus sounded just after 3:30 p.m. in Times Square, rising above the noise of passing traffic and halting some passers-by in their tracks. More than two dozen actors and actresses -- including Andrew Rannells, Carolee Carmello, Jason Gotay, Telly Leung, Norm Lewis and Andrea Burns -- assembled Wednesday afternoon on the tall red staircase that rises above a theater ticket booth. After a few breaths, they launched into the song ""Sunday"" from Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sunday in the Park With George.""

The unadvertised event, directed by the Pulitzer- and Tony-Award-winning composer Tom Kitt and the Tony honoree Michael McElroy, was set up by a volunteer organization, NYCNext, which has sought to counter the effects of the coronavirus pandemic by producing what it calls public ""moments of joy."" James Sampliner and the Tony and Emmy winner Billy Porter provided the song arrangement, along with McElroy. Standing among the ensemble on the staircase was Bernadette Peters, who played Dot, one of the main characters in ""Sunday in the Park,"" which debuted on Broadway in 1984.

Peters said before the performance that she hoped the song ""Sunday,"" which in the musical helps to create calm during a fractious moment, could do the same in real life. ""We can't move around, we can't gather, we can't go to the theater,"" she said. ""We need something that can be a healing balm.""

The performance comes at a precarious time for the theater. Broadway and Off Broadway houses have been closed since March, and although a few shows have announced opening dates in March 2021 -- a major one, ""The Music Man,"" is aiming for May -- the future is uncertain.

NYCNext was started in August by Andy Lerner, who has led tech start-ups, and Maryam Banikarim and Caroline Donahue, both of whom have worked as marketing executives. It aims to support the city's cultural community by showcasing performers at a time when venues are closed and providing the participants with stipends. The effort was born of impatience with the notion that New York City would not be able to recover from the pandemic, said Banikarim, adding: ""We believe the best way to revitalize our city is through the arts."" Its first event took place in Chelsea on Sept. 25 when the Grammy-nominated pianist and composer Elio Villafranca and his band performed on the sidewalk of West 21st Street near Ninth Avenue. On Tuesday a poet named Mahogany Browne recited works in Central Park. Future events are expected to include performances by jazz musicians, comedians and dancers. To avoid drawing a crowd that might make social distancing difficult, NYCNext does not publicly promote these events. The fact that performances are not announced adds a serendipitous element of discovery to the moment, Lerner said, adding: ""You just stumble into something amazing that only happens in New York.""","Two dozen shielded performers, including Bernadette Peters and Andrew Rannells, surprised passers-by with a rendition of Stephen Sondheim's ""Sunday.""",b596449a-9044-50f1-8de2-178bfed563ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/07/arts/07bway-item-7/merlin_178198113_01bb3373-a71d-4234-8069-3739b69dc515-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=3cd85e2c54c8c0418834e8604494ea8b6f361f926ccb9895423e8f55cb8d69ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bernadette Peters attends Broadway Next Event on the TKTS stairs in Times Square on October 7th, 2020.",b596449a-9044-50f1-8de2-178bfed563ad,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/b596449a-9044-50f1-8de2-178bfed563ad.jpg,10
Fashion & Style,Movie Star Dane DeHaan: He Broods. He Pouts. He ... Golfs?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/fashion/mens-style/dane-dehaan-actor-leading-man-valerian-golf.html,"Credit...Ryan Pfluger for The New York Times; Styled by Alex Tudela



Dane DeHaan has watery, nearly translucent blue eyes -- somewhere between mysterious and radioactive, ""made for cinema,"" according to the director Derek Cianfrance -- and a haunted stare that has made him Hollywood's go-to avatar of teenage torment. In the few years he has been acting on film, he has played a high-school loner turned telekinetic terrorist (""Chronicle""), the troubled son of an absent father (in Mr. Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines""), and a tortured analysand (""In Treatment""). So when a reporter asked Mr. DeHaan what they might spend an afternoon doing together, the answer came as a surprise. ""I always say if I could do anything, I would be a professional golfer,"" said Mr. DeHaan, whose handicap is a country-club respectable 12, on a windy December morning at the driving range at Chelsea Piers in New York. ""But I'm not good enough, so I'm an actor."" He reared back and drove into a golf ball with a satisfying thwack, and it sailed out toward the Hudson River. Finding one of American film's favorite young interpreters of subcutaneous roil on the links (or the range, barring that) was not what I expected, I told Mr. DeHaan. ""No one expects me to golf,"" he said. ""I don't think there are so many moody, brooding people on golf courses. But I always say that golfing and acting are very similar to me. I think they're both singular practices. It's something that no matter how hard I work at, or practice, I will never be as good as I want to be."" (There's that roil.)

Actually, Mr. DeHaan contests the descriptions, now standard, of him as a tortured-artist type (though he did recently play James Dean in ""Life,"" a Dean biopic). He has played happy-go-lucky (in John Hillcoat's 2012 bootlegging period piece ""Lawless"") and straight man to a marauding zombie girlfriend (""Life After Beth""). But it is Mr. DeHaan's brittle soulfulness that has booked him four Prada ad campaigns and kept him on lists of soon-to-break-out stars. That break has been primed by independent films like ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" and the studio-system imprimatur of a key role as the Green Goblin in ""The Amazing Spiderman 2."" In 2017, he is headlining, for the first time in his career, two major films. ""A Cure for Wellness,"" a creepy thriller from Gore Verbinski, the director of ""The Ring"" and the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, comes out next month, with Mr. DeHaan in nearly every frame. And Luc Besson's ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,"" a reportedly $180 million sci-fi spectacular -- the most expensive film ever made in Europe, according to Variety -- follows in July, with hopes of expanding into a franchise. In that one, Mr. DeHaan is not the surly teenager or the supporting villain: He is, for the first time, the hero, Valerian himself -- with a supermodel consort, no less: Cara Delevingne.

""I feel like Hollywood can really take people, take a hold of them and make them feel pressure that doesn't need to be there,"" he said. ""I don't want Hollywood to influence me, I want to influence Hollywood."" He now shuttles there a week or two a year for meetings. (He also admits he takes himself too seriously ""almost all the time."") ""I think a lot of people put that pressure on themselves,"" he said, gazing out over the driving range. ""I think people feel like this is their moment and they have to capitalize on it, or whatever. I want to do this forever. So I'm more than happy to just kind of let things happen."" It helps that he has not been without an acting job since graduating from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in 2008. He had been so eager to act that he finished high school there as well, as part of its high school program. ""I never waited tables out of school,"" he said. ""I waited tables summers between college in anticipation of waiting tables."" His return to the restaurant never arrived. He followed a well-worn path -- the ""Law & Order"" guest appearance, Off Broadway theater, recurring roles on HBO -- before crossing over onto the big screen. Luckily, he added, even if doing ""The Aliens,"" a three-man play by the Pulitzer winner Annie Baker, which he performed in a 104-seat theater and for which he won an Obie Award, was ""one of the best experiences of my career."" ""Still,"" he added, ""when I was doing Off Broadway plays, I would have been making more money collecting unemployment."" Mr. DeHaan looks younger than his 30 years, and his delicate, almost alien handsomeness makes him an unusual fit for a Hollywood megastar. He had to adopt a ""bro lifestyle"" to bulk up for ""Valerian."" But he has always found support among directors, including Steven Spielberg, who cast him in a small part in ""Lincoln,"" and Mr. Cianfrance.

At the time of his casting in that film, Mr. DeHaan was not well known; Mr. Cianfrance had not seen any of his other films. ""There was discussion of other more established actors for that role, and actors that would have secured financing in an easier way in that time,"" he said. ""But across the board, he was undeniable."" Mr. DeHaan has an intensity that holds the screen, whether he is uncovering the sinister truth about a Swiss spa in ""A Cure for Wellness"" (""We want to do what 'Jaws' did to a day at the beach to the health spa,"" Mr. Verbinski said) or battling aliens as a time-traveling special agent in ""Valerian."" ""With Dane, 30 seconds after I sat down at the bar with him, the restaurant, I knew that it was him, for sure,"" said Mr. Besson, the director of ""Valerian."" ""After one minute, my problem is, if he says no, I'm in trouble. It was already printed in my head."" ""Valerian"" is a different kind of film, and a different kind of acting, for Mr. DeHaan, who is classically trained and speaks reverently of ""doing"" rather than ""acting."" (On the inside of his forearm, ""i do."" is tattooed in tiny letters, as a reminder.) ""Valerian"" was shot largely in front of a blue screen, for the visual effects to be added in later. And yet, Mr. Besson said, ""you can see what he's seeing. He's watching the alien or the spaceship. You have no doubt about it.""","After years of supporting work and high-profile Prada campaigns, an actor known for his translucent eyes and angsty roles headlines two major films.",7b321a2f-658c-5406-b4a3-0af1eaff9e44,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/13/fashion/13COVER/13COVER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=cbbd562323daaa78b5719d67930131f4f66787caf8e839357bb216bd42d1f33c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dane DeHaan has become Hollywood's go-to avatar of teenage torment.

Media,"Young Sheldon, Meet SpongeBob: CBS and Viacom Are Back Together",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/business/media/viacom-cbs-merger.html,"After more than a decade apart, CBS and Viacom are reuniting. In a deal that closed on Wednesday, the CBS Corporation, the company behind the broadcast network CBS and the publisher Simon & Schuster, merged with Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and the cable outlets MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. The combination brings together a set of businesses that once dominated the media and entertainment industries but are now fighting to stay relevant in an increasingly digital world. CBS and Viacom were already corporate siblings before the deal, both controlled by National Amusements, a theater company that grew into a major conglomerate under the mogul Sumner M. Redstone, who is ailing at age 96. His daughter, Shari Redstone, emerged as the company's leader in recent years and had sought a merger since 2016. With the deal, Ms. Redstone cements her role as a trailblazing figure in a male-dominated industry, a woman whose peers now include leaders of media behemoths like Brian Roberts of Comcast and Robert A. Iger of the Walt Disney Company. Now that Disney has joined Netflix and Amazon as a force in the streaming industry, the merger is meant to make ViacomCBS, as the new company will be called, a bigger player in digital entertainment than the two companies had been as separate entities. Unlike its streaming rivals -- a group that includes Apple, with its new Apple TV Plus streaming service, and AT&T, the owner of HBO Max, scheduled to make its debut in May -- ViacomCBS will focus on supplying films and television series to other companies. With an executive team led by Ms. Redstone, the chairwoman of the company's board, ViacomCBS intends to follow a strategy of selling its wares to the highest bidder as demand for original content increases.

The number of streaming subscribers around the world surpassed the number of cable subscribers for the first time last year, and Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other platforms are fighting to attract customers who have cut the cord or are one cable technician visit away from doing so. That has set off a frenzy of activity among the streaming companies, and ViacomCBS has already started to take advantage of the new demand. Paramount's TV arm, for example, created ""Jack Ryan,"" a popular series on Amazon Prime Video, and CBS has produced content, like the true-crime drama ""Unbelievable"" and the comedic thriller ""Dead to Me,"" that streams exclusively on Netflix. In October, Viacom sold streaming rights to the animated comedy series ""South Park"" to AT&T's HBO Max in a deal worth $500 million.

ViacomCBS also has a small toehold in streaming services with CBS All Access and Showtime, which together have more than eight million subscribers and feature originals such as the reboot of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek: Picard,"" which is scheduled to have a January debut. Viacom's free, ad-supported streaming service, Pluto, has more than 20 million viewers a month. From 2000, when National Amusements acquired CBS, until 2006, the two companies were a single entity. Mr. Redstone split them apart when the Viacom properties were growing faster than the CBS broadcast network and radio stations. A reunification was seen as necessary now that television audiences have eroded and the movie business is adjusting to streaming. The creation of ViacomCBS is a victory for Ms. Redstone, whose efforts to bring about a merger drew opposition from the CBS Corporation board, including its former chief executive Leslie Moonves. Mr. Moonves was pushed out last year after several women accused him of sexual misconduct, charges he has denied. Some analysts have questioned the deal, saying it may not be enough to fend off the decline in traditional television. Michael Nathanson, an analyst with the Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson, said ViacomCBS would have to ""explain how the combination helps better insulate it"" from the current pressures on the cable and satellite business.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The merger seems to be largely a ""defense play,"" he said. ""For the stock to work, they have to prove that their current strategy is either building long-term asset value or generating more attractive"" returns, he said. ""If they can't, we remain in purgatory."" Shares of both CBS and Viacom have dropped about 20 percent since the merger was announced in August.

David Nevins, the head of Showtime, has been put in charge of overseeing collaborative efforts between programmers across both CBS and Viacom, reporting to both Mr. Bakish and Mr. Ianniello. Mr. Nevins is directly in charge of programming for CBS, Showtime and BET. He has also developed a close working relationship with Ms. Redstone. This is the first season in decades that CBS programming has come from someone other than Mr. Moonves, who was often credited with the network's ratings dominance over the past decade. For this season so far, CBS has lost the crown to NBC, with ratings falling more than 12 percent from last year. The 2019-20 television season could ultimately shake out differently. On a conference call with analysts last month, Mr. Ianniello predicted that CBS would finish the season in May ""as America's most-watched network."" The deal is the last in the current wave of media megamergers. Two major transactions totaling more than $150 billion closed just last year. AT&T buttoned up its $80 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Shortly thereafter, the Walt Disney Company beat out its rival Comcast to win the majority of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox business for $71.3 billion. But the combination of CBS and Viacom amounts to a fraction of those deals, underscoring the need for such a merger. The equity value of the new business is about $25 billion, putting it far behind rivals like Disney, which also has a theme parks business, and NBCUniversal, which is owned by the cable giant Comcast. Several key advisers to Ms. Redstone have suggested a bigger deal could come in the future, with ViacomCBS selling to a tech giant, four people familiar with those discussions have said. Even so, Ms. Redstone is not in a rush to sell off a business she has just spent years pulling together, they added. When asked if ViacomCBS was large enough to compete against its supersize competitors, Ms. Redstone said it would be a mistake to confuse a company's value with its heft.","Shari Redstone gets her wish, bringing about the merger of two media giants in a $25 billion deal.

Sports,"Relocated From a Park to a Football Stadium, the Miami Open Emphasizes Luxury",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/sports/tennis/miami-open-hard-rock-stadium.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Stephen M. Ross swears he is not embroiled in a third-set tiebreaker with Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who bought the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis players and fans. Still, when the moved and improved Miami Open begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of Ross's Miami Dolphins, it will not be hard to imagine Ross, a billionaire real estate developer, keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket. ""Larry's done a great job,"" Ross said. ""He set the bar high, and it's all great for tennis. But for us, it's more natural not to compete, or at least to do so in our own way."" Ross, who bought the Dolphins in 2008 and spent $550 million renovating the stadium, stepped in when IMG, which owns the Miami Open, found itself at an impasse with a Key Biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since 1987.

That man, Bruce Matheson, refused to allow $50 million worth of renovations to the Crandon Park site, and his prolonged lawsuits convinced the tournament that it was time to go. Rather than see the tournament -- and its hundreds of millions in local revenue -- uprooted from South Florida to Orlando or China, Ross decided to partner with IMG and move the tournament about 20 miles northwest to his football stadium. He spent an additional $72 million to transform it into a state-of-the-art tennis venue. The move wasn't well received by everyone. ""Key Biscayne had a very intimate setting, and you can't beat the drive over the Rickenbacker Causeway, with blue water on both sides of you,"" said John Isner, the defending Miami Open champion. ""We had a lot of history in that place, and that stadium court will always be very special to me."" At the new site, a temporary main court was erected on the football field, with half of the seats were blocked off by screens. A 5,191-seat grandstand court, two other show courts and eight additional match courts -- all permanent -- were built on top of parking lots. On a recent tour, those lots were indiscernible behind purple flowers, artificial grass, 35-foot mature palm trees costing $35,000 a pop, and a giant fountain that guards one of the many entrances to the stadium. There is also a 40-by-90-foot video screen, the largest in tennis, just outside the stadium in a spot modeled after Wimbledon's Henman Hill, minus the grass.

The change recalls the United States Open's move from the charming but outgrown West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills in 1978 to the more functional, if less romantic, U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in nearby Flushing Meadows. It took a while to get used to the new digs, but no one would ever want to go back to the old ones.

""This place has a much larger footprint, so we can do more things,"" said Tom Garfinkel, the Dolphins' chief executive. ""We are giving people an unprecedented luxury experience in tennis, just like the N.F.L."" Tournament organizers did not take the word ""luxury"" lightly. The stadium court -- painted in colors called Oasis Blue and Biscayne Blue -- seats 13,800, the same as the main court in Key Biscayne. But this court features 4,738 premium seats, many that resemble Barcaloungers, with individual television screens. These seats range in price from $50,000 to $70,000 for the two-week tournament. Some are right on the court. Premium-seat packages, most of which were sold out two months before the start of the tournament, include private dining rooms. Some suites have seats made out of Ferrari leather. For a privileged 1,000 visitors, there is a dedicated entrance from a private parking lot, in which spectators pass through a tent lined with art, including works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol that can be purchased for upward of $1 million. Ticket prices at every level have increased by up to 40 percent over last year, though several thousand grounds passes are available for as little as $15 each day. Sales by the end of last month were up 25 percent, thanks, in part, to Dolphins season-ticket holders who have been cajoled into watching tennis. ""There's a bit of a challenge in giving people the confidence that this really is for the best,"" said James Blake, the tournament director.

Ross helped choose everything on the site: the flowers, the gigantic paintings that line the stadium corridors, the tiles on the bathroom walls. ""I had a picture in my head of what I wanted this to look like, the same way I do my real estate deals,"" said Ross, who is also behind Manhattan's Hudson Yards project. ""It's all in the details. Little things matter. People notice, and they're watching for those details."" The number of practice courts, many with spectator seating, have doubled from those at Key Biscayne, to 18. But unlike in Key Biscayne, those courts will not be turned over for the public to play on after the tournament ends.

 The players, at least, should be happy. Their amenities have been enhanced, with dining areas and gym spaces tripling in size. The top eight seeds in the men's and women's singles draws, as well as all former champions, will be given private suites to be used by their entourages. But organizers see the event as more than a tennis tournament. The grounds will open at least two hours before play begins each day to encourage people to come early to eat, shop and listen to concerts by local musicians. ""What we wanted was a venue that would allow us the freedom and flexibility to grow and innovate the event,"" said Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, IMG's parent company. ""Key Biscayne was lovely, but we simply outgrew it. What we've got now is going to be supernatural, like walking through a Lollapalooza, and a tennis tournament grew out of it. Forget becoming the fifth major, we're the new U.S. Open.""","The moved and improved Miami Open, a top men's and women's tennis tournament, begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins.",79b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/18/sports/18miamiopenweb1/18miamiopenweb1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=3473d9f35599d9c324442a510aa1b169d0b3c129b20c580e72e3b5b51f8b1ad1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Miami Open, which begins this week, has moved from a Key Biscayne park to Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Dolphins.",79b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df,/Demo_data/D1_imgs_2/79b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df.jpg,9
