 Best of Eurovision article 

The event took place in Hamburg , Germany. I know because I voted after clicking a link from the official website of the Eurovision Song Contest (http://www.eurovision.tv). Ruslana was named the BEST OF EUROVISION after receiving 71209 voted from the internet , the 12 points from the jury and also she was on the first place at the TV voting. Ruslana didn't commented nothing about this.She didn't claimed that she was on the first place. So the article should remain as before. That event took place. Also , on Ruslana's forums exists a topic about this where Ruslana's fans were announced to vote for her. Also , NDR's official websited had the poll results in """"Interaktive"""" section."""

 Original author and valid reference 

Hi. I responsible for the making of the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), and I also freely gave them away to WIkipedia commons.

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and in the same time include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
And honestly, do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including the research?

According to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my work as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.

Consensus means that every body must agree and I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether the people who are continuously deleting my reference are making a terribly wrong and stupid act? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and other contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text, see below!!

Zeno's paradoxes are unrelated to infinite divisibility.  The latter questions how an infinite many parts can total to a finite whole,

 == Difference in dialects (Ashkenazi, Sephardic, etc) == 

 I just undid some edits that added some new information, but did so in a seemingly biased way. I'm unsure whether the factual information is correct so I wanted to open up discussion here to see if it could be added in without also expressing a POV. Here are the parts I removed: 
 *There is a distinction between Sephardi and Mizrahi Hebrew. Here is how the editor expressed it: 
 **Sephardi Hebrew, used by Sephardi Jews of the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa, Turkey, and occasionally Iran and France, preserved certain aspects of the Tiberian pronunciation. The schwa is pronounced in all places as a short """"e"""", and the dagesh only applies to certain letters. The """"tav"""" is always pronounced as """"t"""", with or without dagesh (except in certain dialects where it is pronounced as a th without a dagesh). The gutturals are pronounced correctly (i.e. ḥeth is pronounced correctly and NOT as the ch in Bach like it is pronounced in Modern Hebrew).There are two possibilities: the difference disappeared over time in the Sephardic pronunciations, or it never was there in the first place: the pronunciation stems from a separate Hebrew dialect, which always was there, and which e.g. the masoretes did not use as reference. 
 **Mizrahi Hebrew is spoken by the Jews of Arab Countries (i.e. Iraq, Syria etc.) excluding Yemen. It is similar to Sephardi Hebrew except that it recognizes all double letters (i.e. taw and thaw, gimel and ghimel, daleth and dhaleth, etc.) and pronounces the Vav as a w as it was originally pronounced. 
 ***Is this information correct? Is there any indication that some pronunciations are more original or correct? 
 *Yemenite Hebrew is very similar to Mizrahi Hebrew, with some distinctions: 
 **Yemenite Hebrew, which, thought by some to preserve almost all the Classical Hebrew pronunciation, was barely known where the revival took place. It is almost exactly the same as Mizrahi Hebrew. The only differences are the pronunciation of the gimel as jimel and slight differences in the pronunciation of vowels. 
 Is this information sourced enough to warrant including? Is it covered by the mention of subsets of pronunciation?

 I'm not sure we need so much listing & conjecture as to the affiliations of individual rappers (especially unknown ones). It does not provide any useful information...

However, the affiliation of others (especially their specific sets) is not useful, accurate, or very fair to the people listed.

You voted for the Wikinews project, so I'm asking for your participation now. Everything is open, nothing is final. What Wikinews will and can be depends in large part on you. There already is a global Wikinews mailing list for discussing the project. If you are interested at all, please subscribe  coordination is of key importance. There's also an IRC channel #wikinews on irc.freenode.net. Realtime discussion can help to polish up articles.
 
If you're looking for something to do, check out the articles in development and articles in review. Or start a new story in the Wikinews workspace, or ignore the proposed review system - it's up to you. I hope you'll join us soon in this exciting experiment. 01:59, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)"

 Source Material 

Please have links at the bottom to """"witch"""" websites, or wikipedia articles dealing with witches.  Witch Hunter Robin makes a lot of references to the occult that I think it would be helpful if the article covered some of it.  Not all, just enough for more pleasant viewing of the anime.  Obviously most fans of the show are probably into that stuff themselves, and, at the risk of getting into stereotypes, most of them are probably goth chicks or feminist types who like """"strong female leads,"""" e.g. Robin Sena, the main character.  Nevertheless, a substantial number of people, otakus or new fans to Anime, I think would apreciate it, if anime articles would cover whatever references an anime uses.  One of the things I find most annoying about Wikipedia anime articles is that they do not cover references enough.  For example; Shura No Toki is full of historical references, yet, the article on that anime on Wikipedia does not cover it.  Furthermore, for the anime """"Gilgamesh,"""" some background, however brief as needed, would be helpful regarding semitic mythology, not to mention """"remedial"""" quantum physics, as the anime makes extensive use of them.  Without semitic mythology, and a basic understanding of quantum physics, """"Gilgamesh"""" is unwatchable.  You have to be a Jewish college student majoring in Physics, or someone who has read extensively about Judaism and Physics, to understand what the hell is going on.  Ghost in The Shell, similarly, it uses so much computer jargon, part of the reason it has only RECENTLY become popular, is because computer jargon has become a part of the cultural lingo.  Before, animes like GITS were very audience exclusive.  For reference please, consider what I said; no need to turn an article into a mini novel, just some brief coverage, or at least links to the themes, science or history the animes touched on.

The more I think about it, the more I think """"we"""" is the right wording. The problem is that the object of the sentence is """"Penn"""" and without knowing that he said, """"they"""" you're expecting him to use a first person singular, not a first person plural. I think the reason it feels awkward is that when it undergoes the transformation from singular to plural it does become slightly more ambiguous, because """"we"""" refers to a group of people, but only one that includes Penn, which means it's either Penn & Teller or the entire production staff of the show. When you go to """"they"""", it could be any group of people, and because it doesn't say """"he"""", you sort of need to think about what other possible groups Penn could be referring to. Obviously it only takes a few milliseconds to figure out what it means, but if you're reading along at full speed it can break the flow to have that happen.

Regarding the colon wording (Penn said: """"the aim of the show is to ..""""), I understand what  is going for there, but I don't like the way it sounds in that paragraph. When you do it that way, it seems like a non-sequitur. When you have it the other way, it's clear that we, the editors of the encyclopedia, are trying to convey to the readers what the aim of the show is, and we're using Penn's words. When you just say that Penn said something, and the thing that he said is about the aim of the show, the role of that sentence in the paragraph becomes a bit more ambiguous, because it could be that we are trying to convey that this is how Penn thinks about the show, or that we're trying to convey something about Penn himself. I think the way it's written now and where the quote starts removes nearly all that ambiguity. But of course, I could be reading into things way too much. I think it feels natural with the """"we"""" being included in the quote, but maybe  has a better compromise wording that addresses my concerns about non-sequitur.  [talk/contrib] """

RE: MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking your romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

 Move to Marie Leczinska? 

Since English language obviously doesn't have its own name for this woman (Mary Leszczyńska?), Anglophone historians have to choose between Polish spelling - Maria Leszczyńska - and French spelling - Marie Leczinska. French language was, and still is, naturally closer to English than Polish, which is probably why most Anglophone historians choose Marie Leczinska. A quick Google Book Search confirms this: Maria Leszczyńska gets 96 """"English-language"""" results (though all I've seen are Polish books), while Marie Leczinska gets 808 English-langauge results.

Besides being closer to an Anglophone (for whom the article is written), the proposed title has another benefit: the lack of diacritics. """"Diacritics, especially Polish diacritics, make articles much more difficult to link to (it takes me about a minute to track down the proper letter and then copy/paste it), they interfere with proper alphabetization in category listings, are visually very intimidating to many English-speakers, cause confusion for pronounciation, and do not always display correctly on all web browsers.""""

Another posibility is Marie Leszczyńska; it is significantly more popular than Maria Leszczyńska (c. 400 hits), but Marie Leczinska is twice as popular as Marie Leszczyńska. Moreover, Marie Leszczyńska lacks the aforesaid benefit: it contains diacritics.

That being said, I informally propose moving the article to Marie Leczinska.   """

 :::In principle, I don't agree with the sentiment about """"name calling"""". In practice, I like very much what you edited and it is an excellent addition to the article. If I may say so, it definitely moved the article toward another Featured Article nomination.  
 :::But it is not there yet. My concern lies in the idea that we should avoid including a position, labeling it name-calling. What this does is set up an automatic bias and POV. It also means that we, as editors, are taking a position that it is name calling and it is not factually correct (and I don't know if it is name-calling or correct). And, it means that very positive, positive, and balanced commentary will be allowed, and perhaps some very carefully worded negative commentary. But very negative commentary is then excluded. This means that if a number of the most prominent atheists in the western world (or perhaps world) are united in their strong condemnation, it will not be allowed—in an encyclopedia which is supposed to capture all notable ideas.  
 :::The following sentence presents a very positive position: """"Biographers, Mormon and non-Mormon, agree that Smith was one of the most influential, charismatic, and innovative figures in American religious history.""""

 Quick Question on Sephardic Jews... 

Hello all... i'm not a jewish person but have a great deal of interest in both Israel & Judaism, and have doubts as to the meaning of """"sephardic jew""""

Wikipedia & other i-net resources have given me the definition most of you will know (from Iberian peninsula, emigrating to the mediteranean region, etc...) but what raised my doubts is something else.

I recently saw a documentary which claimed that Sephardic jews originated from a tribe in a land adjacent to israel (in the north, though i forgot its ancient name). The king/leader of this tribe was deeply impressed with his jewish neighbours and converted himself, as well as all his people, to judaism...

I can find nothing to back this up, and would love any imput you're wishing to provide..

Thank you all,

The making of humanity Robert Briffault Publisher G. Allen & Unwin ltd., 1919 Original from the University of California Digitized Oct 18, 2007
It must be admitted that, in recoil from the general conspiracy of silence of our histories, several writers who have sought to vindicate the claims of Arab culture have somewhat exaggerated the achievements of Arabian science. Against such loose panegyrics it has been objected, that Arab science produced no surpassing genius and no transcending discovery ; that it was derived from extraneous sources. That is substantially true, but entirely irrelevant. Arab astronomy did not forestall Copernicus or Newton, though without it there would have been no Copernicus and no Newton. Although the complexity of the Ptolemaic system was repeatedly criticized by Moorish astronomers, although Al-Zarkyal declared the planetary orbits to be ellipses and not circles, although the orbit of Mercury is in Al-Farani's tables actually represented as elliptical, although Muhammad Ibn Musa glimpsed in his works on Astral Motion and The Force of Attraction the law of universal gravitation, those adumbrations of the truth were not fruitful of any great reform. The only important facts brought to light by Arabian astronomy, the discovery of the movements of the sun's apogee by Al-Batani, and of the secondary variations of the moon's motion by Abu '1-Wafa, exercised no perceptible influence upon the course of research, and had to be rediscovered by Tycho. Ibn Sina is said to have employed an air thermometer, and1 Ibn Yunis certainly did use the pendulum for the measurement of time ; but neither of those devices, which were independently re- introduced by Galileo, can be counted as a contribution to the growth of science.

That, however, is entirely beside the point. The debt of our science to that of the Arabs does not consist in startling discoveries or revolutionary theories; science owes a great deal more to Arab culture, it owes its existence. The ancient world was, as we saw, pre-scientific. The astronomy and mathematics of the Greeks were a foreign importation never thoroughly acclimatized in Greek culture. The Greeks systematized, generalized and theorized, but the patient ways of investigation, the accumulation of positive knowledge, the minute methods of science, detailed and prolonged observation, experimental inquiry, were altogether alien to the Greek temperament. Only in Hellenistic Alexandria was any, approach to scientific work conducted in the ancient classical world. What we call science arose in Europe as a result of a new spirit of inquiry, of new methods of investigation, of the method of experiment, observation, measurement, of the development of mathematics in a form unknown to the Greeks. That spirit and those methods were introduced into the European world by the Arabs.
Is  Briffault's writing wp:npov? Not when cut and pasted, only when taken in context. The emphasis in this quote is mine, however wp:rs will show that systems and theories of science in the middle ages are those of Aristotle, Archimedes, Galen, Ptolemy, and Euclid. As for the spirit and methods we need a more neutral tone."
""" 

  

 As it's said in the wiki article, nothing has been conclusively proven. Yes, you can say that survey found """"black people are bigger on average"""". But It is less credible than the sizesurvey.com survey because of a lack of any information on the Methodology used and other details. It only has the results. So no credibility at all, and of no use in the wikipedia article. I mean they can't even spell. Looks like a page someone quickly made up to attract viewers (searching on """"penis size) to see their sex personal ads plastered all over the place.  

 If you find a better source which details that survey feel free to add it to the others in wiki article. Even then (with methodology details), it probably won't prove anything (being a self-measured study), and will only be useful noting as anecdotal evidence.  

 Same as the sizesurvey.com survey. You used a good quote which shows it's lack of credibility for showing racial size differences (this is already noted in wiki article). But the same is true of the Jakinworld survey. The sample size of Africans was too low to be of use (1.7%). So I would say both the sizesurvey.com survey and the Jakinworld survey are lacking in credibility for comparing racial sizes. I'd say we should either have both in the article (for fairness and neutrality) as weak anecdotal evidence or not have either. It is questionable.    

 Coolnurse.com doesn't even know where the survey information came from. Interesting read, but not credible. 

 If better studies and surveys are done that conclusively show """"black"""" people are larger on average as a whole (race), then yes, that should be published whether """"diet or god gave it to them"""". As of now, studies show too many discrepancies to make any conclusion.  

 Ok. That was a bit of a mind-bender to all contemplate. I think I need to take a break from this article. Penis Penis Penis... Blah Blah.. Heh. Good debate though. Kudos.

The Message of the Hour
Thank you for your message on my Talk page.  I think it would be very difficult to provide an authorative article on the """"Doctrines of William Branham"""" because there are so many different views among his followers (of whom I am one!).   I think WB's most controversial doctrines among other churches are probably the Trinity, serpent seed, and the role of women. A general overview of these and other subjects would be good.  Weaver's book is not without its own bias (""""Branham was a victim of his own illusions"""", 2000,p173) and errors (""""He believed that the final manifestation of his gift would transform physical bodies into the glorified ones necessary for the rapture"""", 2000, p173).  Some of Weaver's conclusions can be easily disproved by reference to the over 1,000 audio sermons and transcripts online.   It is also worth noting that WB had more in common with the evangelical and pentecostal churches than is often realized because the focus is usually only on differences.

(Machaut's mass, on reflection, seems to be in four parts but three tessituras.) You are right and the situation is complex: instrumental quartets of the early 16th century (e.g. in Virdung) involved only three tessituras, etc. Let's say that all this deserves comments in the article that we may have in mind (rather than Barber shop quartets singing in unison!). —"

To answer  and in doing so  as well, I do not take to gaming Wikipedia lightly.  Especially when I find myself involved with those editors doing so? Who's gaming wikipedia? Firstly; Arthur Rubin. Have you looked at the laundry list of violations this """"admin."""" has racked up? Deleting other users posts on talk pages, tag team reverting, blocking, edit warring, being blocked etc. etc. etc. A short review of the section on my talk, brought to me by an IP editor too afraid to use their actual user-account informed me of his nefarious record here on Wikipedia. I refuse to walk into a known hostile article with hostile editors waiting to pounce like Subject Trolls. Who set this precedent of a hostile editing environment? Arthur Rubin, whose repeated rule-busting and counter-productive, antagonistic dancing around the issues leads only to toxic situations like this. I am NOT a push-over. Further, the editors in question,  and  make zero suggestions or concessions, oh but the """"undo"""" button never fails to escape their attention.  How many times do I have to say this? These editors have the same stone-wall tactics and bad attitudes responsible for the grid lock in Washington D.C. where only the people/Wikipeia viewer are/is made to suffer. This is why, people like Arthur Rubin should not be a Wikipedia admin., this is why people like Arthur Rubin should not even so much as be Wikipedians. As of now, I will be writing an email to Wikipedia management and demanding his permanent dismissal and subsequent blocking of his most used IP. By the way, it has not escaped me that you haven't made one mention of the inability of either  or  violations of Common Sense or Wikipedia:Assume good faith cornerstones. Have you read the battle that occurred in the Koch Family talk page? Like a good (and apparently """"stupid"""") little Wikipedian, I'm trying to problem solve and placate these obvious POV editors wants, needs, desires and demands and I am rewarded by being given nothing in return. Even though, as stated before and I'll state it again, they enter negotiations with a round of ridiculous arguments, easily explained away then only to return with 3 more for every one I argue down. Wikipedia is one of the most """"Gamed"""" websites there is. The only reason I wont quit is because I know doing so would only go to make users like the ones stated above jovial with relief that their POV pushing may continue un-disrupted.  """

I think that the reputation of the Marine Corps has more to do with its actual historical performance on the battlefield, rather than considerations such as the selectivity of its recruitment or basic training, something that probably would distinguish it in the """"European"""" perspective that you cite.
Another consideration is the scope, size and responsibility of the Corps.  The Marine Corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a """"special-operations-type"""" organization, such as the SEALs, Special Forces, or, if you will, Royal Marines or SAS.  The article points out that the Corps is larger than the British Army in its entirety.  What the Marine Corps has done for most of its history, and what has distinguished it largely from the US Army, is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force, in coordination with the Navy, in a large number of small actions in support of US policy, most of them in the Western Hemisphere or in Asia.  (THe US didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime Army until after 1945).  Outside those years when a major war was being fought (technically, the US Congress has declared war only five times in history), if someone saw an armed American in their country, that person was likely to be a Marine.
I would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the Marine Corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies.  I would invite anyone interested, and will work myself, to find and document in this article reliable quotes and sources of those who have encountered Marines in battle.

 Dear Muslim friend, thank you for your contribution. I feel the need to remind you though that any such experiment would constitute a primary source, which is not allowed in Wikipaedia: we work with secondary sources only... i.e. we work with science not with rumour. Now, having come to rumour, I have seen a pig toilet (in an Eastern European village) myself. Surprise surprise, the pigs did not eat the feces. If they did the owner wouldn't have been forced to clean up the thing weekly. I'm sorry to tell you but this is bollocks! 77.4 is completely right: that would be aomw recycling. And pigs would be the cheapest animals to raise... they would only eat their own feces: feed them once and it would be sufficient for a pig's lifetime. Only thinking at that would give you an inkling of an idea whether your assertions are true or false. 
 Now, as for the science of it, there are plenty of sources that detail what pigs do eat. Feces of any kind is not present in any of those studies. And that's the proof it's not happening. It's not happening under normal circumstances. Homo sapiens, under normal circumstances, does not eat flesh from other homo sapiens. Obviously there have been exceptions under the most unusual of circumstances (groups of people starving to death, cultural constructs etc.) but naturally it doesn't happen.    
 ::::::Dear 79.112.59.92, There is no reason for you to assume someone is Muslim. It is natural for pigs to eat human feces. It is not limited to Goa in India. You can go to any Indian village where pigs are present and see for yourself. Please refute my claim and I will give you 1 million U.S. Dollars. This is my challenge. It should be the same for any European village also. For how many days together did you observe the pigs? How many pigs did you observe? Are you 100% sure they did not eat feces? -   
 ::::::Dear 79.112.59.92, my challenge still stands: show me that a domestic pig does not eat human faeces naturally and I shall give you one million U.S. dollars, but only if I am not able to show you at least hundreds of pigs in India eating human faeces. If they eat you will have to pay me 1 million U.S. dollars, so don't try to run away from the truth. It is not under special circumstances, and I can say boldly that YOU ARE LYING when you saw the pigs in eastern europe (are you sure they were pigs. You love pork and don't like this fact. -

 To me, the lead sentence sounds as if a magnetic field with both a north and a south pole were something special, which is wrong. I admit that the phrasing of the source isn't better, but I think they mean the field has only two poles. Could that be clarified?"

""":I'm not sure what all the issues have been with your edits and the rest of the community. As best as I can determine, the issues are 1) use of code share in lead & 2) changing tense """"is"""" to """"was"""" (based on this edit). In regards to Wikipedia:AVINAME, the guideline is the following (abridged for clarity): 
""""Where an aviation incident article...begins with the opening sentence: Airline Flight XYZ...., it should go on to immediately describe the notability of the incident in as few as words as possible. For this reason, it is not necessary in the opening line to clarify that the flight number may still be in use, or where it is normally scheduled to fly - this is because the normal flight or flight number is not the subject of the article...For example: Madeup Airway Flight 123 was a passenger flight from Somewhere to Somewhere Else, that on such and such a day, failed/crashed/blew up/was hijacked. [correct]"""" 
I think the important part of the guideline is what I italicized. I think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. Whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn't matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the """"incident"""" section. Take a look at the example given in the guideline—Air Florida Flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article Air France flight 447. Both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. I don't think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. It's also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as """"crashed"""", per Wikipedia policies. Taking into account what I said, here is a proposal for the lead:

If an official would just refer to the plane as """"presumed crashed"""", then the following could be added as a second paragraph in the lead:

Thoughts? A good compromise?

"""It is precisely because Presley is singled out for such criticism that it should be mentioned. Well that is your opinion. I would go a different way: The famous musicians (or their fans) who accused him should show their sources (they have the advantage of being alive and are able to defend themselves against accusations). It would make more sence to me to write about the obvious racism of Chuck D and Mary Blidge and a lot of other famous people than about Elvis' non-exixting racism. I think it's is unfair to the music and cultural impact of Elvis that such things got too much space in the article and other much more essential aspects of Elvis did not get mentioned. I think people who are interested in the person and music of Mary Blidge or Chuck D should discuss it on the discussion site of their articles in wikipedia. They should find out if there is racism or not. Or maybe start an article """"racism in showbussiness"""" and dicuss it there. I think you should not let  it become your problem that some people (for instance Chuck D and Blidge obviously) have problems with 1.Elvis being white , 2.the fact that he was from the rural south, 3.that they believe what other people say only because they share a similar pigmentation and repeat it without checking out any sources or 4.that they wanted get simply attention. By the way - Do you think this musicians ever heard one of  A. Crudup's or Kokomo Arnold's songs or even Roy Brown? I think you could write that Elvis was target of racism and accused of being a racist and mentioning some source and footnotes. But for an article about Elvis it is too detailed the way it is. I think give Elvis credit for what he did - positive and negative - and not for what he did not do.

About Elvis meeting the Beatles: Okay they met and there was no chemistry between them. Did it have any impact on Elvis? He did not like the Beatles before and not after they met. It is another anecdote from Elvis' view. But I think it would be worth reading in a article about the Beatles or John Lennon. He meant much more to them than the other way around (positive or negative). I only gave details about the meeting I've read in a german book which proably was not published in english language. It shows a very negative behavior of Elvis and I wished he would have act different but the sources are that way and having the Beatles Anthology on dvd I could see and hear  Ringo Starr telling the story (only McCartney was very, very kind, maybe even a little bit white washing).

I would like to know what you think about my comments about Berry, Perkins, Kokomo Arnold etc.. I think it tells something about the accusation of stealing music. Heard several years ago an interview with Dave Bartholomew when he played in Switzerland where he said he listened with Fats Domino to many songwriters black and white, blues and country, and he bought the best songs, arranged and changed them and put his name (and Dominos) under it. He said that was common and he knew from some former Ellington musicians that the Duke did the same. 87.162.47.181   Franco, Deutschland

The roots of IBM date back the the 1880s, decades before the development of electronic computers. The company was formed through a merger of three different companies: the Tabulating Machine Company (with origins in Washington, D.C. in the 1880s), the International Time Recording Company (founded 1900 in Endicott), and the Computing Scale Corporation (founded 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, USA)..  The merger was engineered by noted financier Charles Flint, and the new company was called the Computing Tabulating Recording (CTR) CorporationMartin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray, Computer a History of the Information Machine — Second Edition, Westview Press, pages 37–39 2004. CTR was incorporated on June 16 1911 in Endicott, New York, U.S.A.. Flint remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in 1930.

The companies that merged to form CTR manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, coffee grinders, and most importantly for the development of the computer, punched card equipment. The product lines were very different, but Flint believed that since they all focused on equipment that made businesses more efficient, there were synergies and cross selling opportunities to be had.  Based in New York City, the new company had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario.

Of the companies merged to form CTR, the most technologically significant was the Tabulating Machine Company, founded by Herman Hollerith, and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879–82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punch cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input. officemuseum.com – early Hollerith history, with good photographs of period equipment

The Tabulating Machine Company originally sold some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day - the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract, and completing the project with amazing speed, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. But creating markets for the new technology was a struggle, and by 1911 Hollerith, now 51 and in failing health, was looking to rest on his laurels. He sold the business to  Flint for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million), who then created C-T-R. Hollerith remained involved with C-T-R for some years as a consultant, but his involvement waned as time went on.

When the diversified businesses of C-T-R proved difficult to manage, Flint turned for help to the former No. 2 executive at the National Cash Register Company, Thomas J. Watson Sr.. Watson became General Manager of C-T-R in 1914 and President in 1915. I Drawing upon his managerial experience at NCR, Watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics: generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen, and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker. As the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company, Watson focused their"

"Sails as wings? 

I think that this might be an oversimplification of the matter, as it depends largely on both the type of rigging being used and the direction (relevant to the wind direction) that one wishs to go.

For instance, many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail. I suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail (thus high pressure area) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move, which is the same principle as that which generates lift. However, unlike in the case of aerofoils (aka wings) there is *not* a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front.

In short, while the pressure differential as cause of movement remains valid, the cause of these pressure differences is not the same as for wings.

Lift (force)

Anyway, hope this helps.

 ==Additional columns== 

 I wonder if it would be worth adding a column for the wild ancestor of each animal?  In many cases it has a different name, often also a separate article, and it may not be obvious what it is without referring to the article.  In some cases the wild ancestor is extinct or is unknown, and this too would be useful information.  In at least one case the domestic animal is extinct but the wild ancestor survives. 

 There is also a considerable amount of inconsistency about which article the animal links to – for example the pigeon is listed as """"Rock Dove"""" but actually links to domesticated pigeon; the rabbit is listed as and links to European rabbit (not domestic rabbit); the guinea fowl links to Helmeted Guineafowl (not domesticated guineafowl).  A separate column for the domesticated and wild animals would clarify all this. 

 It also seems to me that there are two subtly different reasons why someone might want to consult this list.  They may be interested in a list of domestic animal species (which is what we have) – or they may be interested in which wild animal species have been domesticated.  At present the latter information is not here; a separate coloumn would make both easily available. 

 There is a great deal of variation in how far domestication has progressed in each case.  Some (dog, pig, llama, silk worm) are now markedly different species from their wild ancestors; others (mink, budgerigar, cockatiel, fancy rat) really only differ from the wild animals in colour and tameness; still others are barely if at all distinguishable from the wild animal (mute swan, Mandarin duck).  Finally, some species are not really domesticated at all, but are captured from the wild and used by people (Asian elephant, stingless bee, cochineal insect).  There is a note in the text about """"captive-bred"""" or """"semi-domesticated"""" animals, but nowhere in the list to put this information.  How about a column indicating the degree of domestication?    """

"Hi,

Taekkyeon is a sensitive topic because many people want to learn it and not enough qualified teachers to disperse the knowledge. If you truly desire to learn Taekkyeon there are only two masters in the world who know the complete system. One is in S. Korea, he doesn't teach many people. The other lives in Los Angeles, CA. The truth is, you have to either move to Los Angeles or S. Korea if you want to learn the Taekkyeon as taught by GM Song and Im Ho. 
I will tell you this. GM Song was a bodyguard of the remaining Choson Dynasty family memebers. The top Taekkyeon masters always defended the king, They were in the military. Taekkyeon was a military artform first and a civil cultural game for children and adults later. By calling Taekkyeon a civil martial art game is demoting it from its real status. However, Taekkyeon is still a Holistic Martial art with many healing aspects and a civil game for children and adults. Its all three!
Please consider me a friend. Which Taekkyeon association are you affiliated with?"

"""""""From an early age, Shoup was molded by progressive ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives' fighting with the interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude.[9] His skepticism about American foreign policy influenced by a small-town background would make him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. Shoup felt the use of troops for what he considered economic or imperialist consideration were wrong, and would be a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.[10]"""" There are a few problems with this paragraph.

Is it not good enough that the High Court in Gibraltar amongst others have stated so? Just exactly when is a terrorist a terrorist according to your warped logic or are you being politically correct for the sake of pandering to the minority as I have observed others state?   
As a relatively new user I fail to see your logic.  WP:Terrorist clearly states that the term terrorist can be used where there is unequivocal support for such which by the way is the case here. McGuinness was a terrorist and further more, a terrorist leader and the commander of the PIRA in Londonderry for many years; this is verifiable fact. It is therefore quite correct for this information to be attributed to McGuinness...if editors don't like the term then that is a matter for them. Martin McGuinness was a terrorist."

Fine, the Dominion of Canada, is a free country.  The """"footnote"""" was not the basis of my arguement.   Constitutional Law does not afford the retroactive re-naming of terms within a Constitutional Act.   Each term that is repelled must be specifically indicated.  Each Clause that is replaced, must be explicitly indicated.

Your grasp of Constitution Law and procedures is complete ill-informed.  Do you have any idea the Constitutional Chaos that would be created in any present day independent country, that has used as a basis English Common-Law as a template? (i.e., the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)

 Despite all the talk about the Tiffie being an air superiority fighter/interceptor it seems genuine plans are being laid to make it a bomber as well. Flight International has an interesting article about plans for training aircrew. Has some other interesting points too such as operational history and whether or not the plane will make its combat debut in the only likely UK warzone, Afghanistan. We can but hope they regain some sort of peace over there before the Tiffie gets its chance. More money wasted no doubt. Maybe there are still some ex-Jaguar jocks around who can pitch in. 

 It ends with a salutary point that the RAF's first Typhoon qualified QWI course for multirole pilots when it starts in 2009, will be the first of its type since it retired its McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms (in?).

 The Riflemen's Song at Bennington 

Removed:

However an isolated earlier use of this term relating to the American War of Independence appears in """"The Riflemen's Song at Bennington"""", an old folk song that supposedly goes back to the 1770s.

Which does indeed refer to the 1777 Bennington Battle but there is nothing to date the song, particularly the Red Coat version. Possibly the original lyric was: """"Why come ye hither, stranger? Your mind what madness fills? In our valleys there is danger, And danger on the hills"""" which seems to have become """"Why come ye hither, Redcoats, your mind what madness fills? In our valleys there is danger, and there's danger on our hills."""" for the Burl Ives collection Historical America in Song from 1950.

Part III

What's with blanking out the names completely? So much for compromise. I'm going back to COUNTING the pre-1925 champions. Here's why:

1. The outside sources, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, list them.

2. All the arguments that could be made against the pre-1925 French tournament could also be made against the other three.

3. The idea of the """"slam"""" didn't even emerge until the 1930s, with Don Budge...but do we see anyone black out pre-1938 Wimbledon champs?

4. It's clear that the French tournament was MORE open...their first champ was a Brit, as was two runners-up in the early decades. Interestingly, the US """"Open"""" in 1881 was open only to Americans, and was for several years. Yet we count them, because that's the origin of the tournament.

5. There's also the pro-am dispute, pre-1968. 

6. Wikipedia is supposed to reflect pluralistic viewpoints, not just the one of one person such as Fyunclick who violates WP:OWN to contort this and similar tennis articles to reflect his own views, rather than reflecting outside sources that existed long before Wikipedia did.

MOVED BACK FROM MY TALK PAGE:
 Moved from London Victory Parade discussion page 

As this exchange has nothing to do with the topic of the article and has everything to do with you assuming that I am editing in bad faith and trying to catch me out in a way which is quite frankly pathetic, I am moving it from that discussion page to your talk page.  

What is the title of the book you wrote about Warsaw, Varsovian? Do you know what """"M-ka"""" is ? You lived in Warsaw for ten years , you said above. Please tell me what M-ka is.  
Travellers Warsaw. Not only do I have no idea what M-ka is but my assistant (27 years old, born in Warsaw and lived here her whole life) and the professor in the office next to me (56 years old and spent entire life in Warsaw) have no idea what you're talking about either.  
What part of Warsaw you or your assistant lived in?  
I live in Muranow, she lives in Saska Kepa. Has this got anything to do with the London Victory Parade of 1946?  
Is this the book you wrote?..I'm sure the answer is in a very book you claim to write... Ask your assistant what is N24-rka then. I'm really trying hard to convince myself that you are a real account. Please help me. Thansk  
No, I wrote the second edition. And took about a quarter of the photos too. Why not buy a copy and read it from cover to cover: you will not find the words M-ka or N24-ka anywhere in it. However, you will find a rather good joke about Copernicus (or at least a good joke for anybody who knows their Monty Python).  
Well...if you lived in Warsaw and your assistant lived in Saska Kepa whole her life she would for sure knew what N24-rka is. It is the number of only night bus that goes to Saska Kepa. People in Warsaw or """"Varsovians"""" just know these things. I was born in Warsaw and I lived there for many years. Everybody knows buses and trams numbers especially in their areas. EVERYBODY. If you asked me what M-ka or N24-rka is I would tell you right away and even in the middle of the night. But thanks anyway Varsovian.  
You really are comedy gold! Firstly, to speak for myself I have no idea which night bus I would take to get home: I use these things called taxis. Secondly my assistant says that you are an idiot (although I would never use such incivil language to you). N24 does not go to Saska Kepa: it goes to Praga-Poludnie. To get to Saska Kepa she would take N72.  
Of course Varsovian...whatever you say[].  
Thank you for yet again implying that I am a liar. I do wonder if it is ever possible for you to actually be civil towards people. Thank you for your comments as to which bus goes where. I suggest that you contact ZTM (the Warsaw municipal transport company) and tell them that their website is completely wrong: they list the N24 as not going to Saska Kepa  and the N72 as going to Saska Kepa . But obviously you are right and they (and people who actually live in Warsaw) are wrong. Please feel free to treat those sources as you do all sources which do not agree with your point of view, i.e. delete them.  """

As a Conservative I think we need to LIONIZE Senator Kerry   
-    
- I think we need to add a section APPLAUDING Kerry's DENIGRATING AND INSULTING cheap shot insults directed at our brave soldiers in Iraq.   
-    
- After all, Senator Kerry just insured that conservatives will maintain control of both the House AND Sentate this year with his DESPICABLE comments.   
-    
- My DEEPEST condolences to Kerry apologists and liberal editors at Wikipedia (in other words, AT LEAST 90% of you.)   
-    
- In 2004, the dems and their LIBERAL enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Viet Nam, figuring it gave Kerry an edge. So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)   
-    
- In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.   
-    
- And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.    
-    
- Except not quite the way they intended. LOL!!!   
-    
-    
-    
- And no, saying it was 'joke' just won't cut it.    
-    
- This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops. From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.   
-    
- And saying, 'Hey! I wasn't trying to insult our troops, just our Commander in Chief!'   
- only makes it worse. The American Legion certainly isn't buying it.   
-    
-    
- Perhaps you liberal wikipedia editors want to attack them too!

According to these rules each of you are in violation which is my point exactly. 

Look, I exspect censorship from a Marine/Gov't loyal contributor.  Especially in the current political environment where wire taps are viewed as Protective, internet privacy is irrelevant, a president can invent and enforce any law he chooses, and  Guantanamo is synonymous with """"due process"""". 

Hell, by those standards, I should be thankful for """"censorship"""" as the new """"Liberty"""". Well as Joe Lieberman has shown us, """"times they are a changin'."""" Don't understimate creativity. That is where the conservatives always lose. They are virtually incapable of creativity. It is why Hollywood is so """"left & democratic"""" as they are the creative types and tend not to have the same limitations as our red faced, red party friends.

Read my edit and contribution history and see just how many times as I have been called names or disparaged by conservatives and other editors, but I have never opted to just """"rat"""" them out for reverting, or editing in an opinion. I got balls to big for that, but it never fails to amaze me how quickly you guys run from a conversation you can't win, and how often you beg for the help of your mommy or daddy admin. Is that the semper fi tradition? Call daddy when you can't argue a point? I have come to expect conservatives to consistently censor thoughts and ideas they disagree with. Historically you guys also burned books, authors, and speakers as a first action rather than pretend to offer debate.  

I have always felt a bit of pity at that being the first step and not a last resort but, like the Iraqi's throwing rocks and blowing themselves up, you gotta use what limited tools you have available and in this case, I guess that means calling for """"admin"""" help when you get in a tight spot?

 :It was contemporaneous with Yixianosaurus, which on your chart is THE first, genetically, example of fossil feather impressions.

"In Japan, Nobukatsu Fujioka, a professor of Takushoku University, mentioned, “Many translated books are published in Japan but Iris Chang’s “The Rape of Nanking” is not published. Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.”
 
Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China. This was a purported Japanese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka laid out for Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same. If we leave this lie as it is, it will certainly give a bad influence to the US-Japan relation.”"

 ==Religion and Wikipedia== 

 I understand that the spelling """"Jehovah"""" (especially its vowels) is of paramount importance to followers of the Jehovah's Witnesses religion.   If it were not, this article would not exist. 

 However, Wikipedia policy is explicit that articles must follow scholarly convention and scholarly consensus.  One cannot make an article on Wikipedia conform to the doctrines of the Jehovah's Witnesses, nor may one compel editors to conform their edits to any religion whatsoever. 

 Convention and the scholarly consensus are quite clear in regard to the use of the word """"Jehovah"""" and official statements from official sites of the Jehovah's Witnesses differ markedly.  This version of this article here:   is sourced and cited.  It also incorporates the contributions of numerous editors, including that of Jehovah's Witnesses. 

 Each Jehovah's Witness is certainly welcome to his own point of view.  The Jehovah's Witnesses have their own websites and there is even a section in this article allowing for discussion of these views.  The overwhelming majority of editors do not follow that religion, but the community has been generous and even indulgent in incorporating these sectarian views in the article. 

 Thus, in the interests of Policies and Guidelines  particularly Wikipedia is not a soapbox, Jehovah's Witnesses are strongly urged to cease conforming articles against scholarly convention and consensus.  More importantly, kindly cease from demanding that editors follow sectarian religious doctrine.  Editors take offense at such tactics and are unlikely to comply.   

 We consider it rude and it reflects badly on Jehovah's Witnesses. 

 There are ample websites already owned by Jehovah's Witnesses for followers to contribute to.  All are welcome to contribute here inasmuch as each follows the rules.  -    """

As the nominator, I want to thank you for taking the time to do an in-depth review of the article.  I was guilty of sinking in unsigned responses to some of your comments in order to communicate progress.  The article was renominated in September after three intensive days of full time effort to address all of the concerns from the prior GA review (which was summarily rejected without any interaction.)  I thought that a featured article should certainly meet GA criteria and we designated the article as the August 2010 Wikiproject Universities collaboration of the month.  The result was an improved article including many new footnotes, mostly to source the fact that the notable alumni actually attended Cornell. To give the collaboration a valid end point I nominated the article for GA, and renominated it after addressing the listed concerns, not aware of the defects that you uncovered.  Because the GA queue is months long, there was a peer review between the second GA nomination and your review, although that review ended up mostly focusing on images.

 In  1990 ties in the town of Bawashiha near Moscow, there were special trainings for the serviceman of FDB (previously prior to 1991 KGB)  who supposed to specialize in organized assassinations of the heads of foreign governments.   

 The retired (for cause)on 28 of August 2008 Commanding officer of Polish 36 Special Squadron of Aviation Transport Colonel Tomasz Pietrzak, ex pilot summarized in several interviews  the events related to the risks, operational procedures and disclosed some of the issues pertaining to the alleged """"accident"""".

 The fact that there is lack of evidence (in English)is NOT an evidence. 
 Majority of evidence is in either POLISH or Russian language, while  reports  by western journalists are  frequently written by classical airheads with no knowledge and understanding basics of events in this political assassination. 

 There was a  TAWS (made by Avionics Systems of Tucson, Arizona) system on the plane  which by the directive of 36 squadron piloting the  VIOPs should be for operational reasons disabled.

Hello Truthspreader, you should know that the whole reform section on the Muhammad article is being turned into a new article.

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.

Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are;

Here are some sources backing up my statement;

http://www.wonderquest.com/eye-color-age.htm (states hazel eyes are light brown or yellowish brown) 

http://www.fanteye.com/extimages/p_FreshlooksColorblendsChartLG.jpg (shows a pure hazel eye, big difference to the green eye diagonally below to the right) 

http://www.colormecontacts.com/colored-contacts-for-dark-eyes (puts hazel eyes in the same category as honey, not green plus displays a green eye with abit of brown (central heterochromia) under the green category) 

http://www.yestheyrefake.net/color_contacts_buy_photos.htm (shows hazel eyes in numerous pictures presenting them as a golden brown) 

http://hazeleyes-wintergoddess.blogspot.com.au/2009/07/hazel-eyes.html (states the North American misconception and the true/original European definition while showing examples of various sources, numerous pictures and comments below of people agreeing and showing gratitude)

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_definition_of_Hazel_eyes (states the misconception and says that hazel eyes are supposed to match the hazel or cob nut, the fruit of the hazel bush/tree that grows in Europe)

http://m.rateitall.com/iPhone/item.aspx?p=0&ItemID;=1074601 (shows an optometrists opinion/experience with the issue while stating the North American hazel eye misconception and providing sources backing up his statement)

Hazel Eye Picture On The Right

The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes, as it is blue with central heterochromia (brown around the pupil). The hazel eye description says nothing about hazel eyes being blue in any way, so i trust this is a mistake that needs to be changed immediately, i propose one of the following pictures be shown in it's place as they match a golden light brown hazelnut colour:

Two things about that. One is that before worrying about the lead we should finish the discussion of naming in the body of the article. The place to do that would be the """"Name change"""" section? Currently we have a lot of sources speculating on what would replace Metro. Now, in retrospect, we know. Second, we should keep the design language separate from what is produced with the design language (the UI). IMO """"Metro design language"""" is fine as the article title. It's the historical name that everyone knew. If anything,  """"Microsoft design language"""" would seem to be the strongest candidate to replace it. But this is different from all of the different official and unofficial names for the UI that users see, which tend to be tied to the products  Zune UI, Windows Store apps, etc. –   """

Wikilinks
How territorial of you to undo all my wikilinks just so you could put them all back yourself. Some of them you didn't even put back right, hence the friendly notice left on your talk page; you still have some DAB links left. How is this clearer and who does that? Who will purposely undo what a previous editor didwhich actually helped the pagejust so they could micromanage a page and do it all over again themselves... but worse. I don't get it. I followed your dance-style-on-the-card rule and I added wikilinks which weren't there before. We were on the SAME SIDE Snow. We both want a better page. Pay attention. If you were thinking clearly instead of obsessing over a page you think belongs to you, all you would have had to do after I originally added the wikilinks is fix mambo, tango, b-boying, and kalinka (they all linked to disam pages). Then everything would have linked fine. Instead you undo everything I linked. Then you (re)add links all back and end up creating more disambiguation links than what existed before. You even linked to some pages which aren't even helpful. Example: you changed """"Tap dance"""" back to """"Tap dancing"""" and """"Krumping"""" back to """"Krump"""". The only reason why I changed the way the words ended in the first place was to provide a link directly to their respective articles instead of to the redirects (not because I'm being subjective). But you change the links back so that they point to the redirects. It's not like your helping people in their understanding. All you did was link those dance styles back to redirect pages instead of to the actual articles. How petty is that. Take Bollywood for another example. Are you aware of the fact that Bollywood dance redirects to Hindi dance songs? Not to mention the fact that there's also a big huge original research banner at the top of that article. How is this article going to help someone understand Bollywood dance better than the Dance in India article which is where I linked it to before you reverted my edit. If you really didn't like it pointing to that article you could have at least linked it to Bollywood#Bollywood song and dance this time. Either way, at least people reading those pages would understand the dance better than reading an article about Hindi dance songs which has very few citations. Stop being selfish and think about the readers.

Final thoughts
By-the-way, regardless of how the show presents street dance, """"old school"""" is two words and breaking will always be hip-hop dance considering it is one of the pillars of hip-hop culture. That's a fact and not subjective. Read a book, watch a documentary, or educate yourself some other way if you don't want to hear me out. I'm going to change """"old school"""" back to two words because it's good grammar. I'm also going to remove electric boogie, take African out of the jazz dance group, and fix all the disambiguation links you added. Then I'll either make pas de duex it's own row again or put lyrical hip-hop back beside hip-hop. Or maybe do both. Or maybe not even touch them. I haven't decided yet since you have a problem my editing except for the last option. I don't know what you would settle with. Any other changes I make won't be without good reason. I think I've demonstrated that by my long-winded response to your comments. If it kills you to see me make these edits again then go ahead and revert them. At that point, I'll just go to WP:RFC and solicit the opinions of people who don't care about either of us or SYTYCD because I'm not about to argue back-and-forth on this talk page with you considering that you don't WP:OWN the page, you have no sources, and more importantly, you have no WP:CONSENSUS about a rule you made up which you yourself reneged on.

 Tie-break rules in basketball  

Can you give me the exact rules of this situation because I found this:

1) If 2 teams have the same record, the team that won the head to head game wins
the tie breaker.
2) If there are more than 2 teams with the same record, then the tie breaker will be
decided by the point difference in all games played. Please look at the chart below
for an example. All 3 teams ended with 2 wins and 2 loses.
# Team A Team B Team C1 Win + 2  Lose 15   Win +252Lose –10 Lose –9 Lose –33Win +5  Win +7  Lose –24 Lose –2  Win +10  Win + 11Diff. –5  –9  +31

with -5, and Team B will be last with -9.

Why exactly is it 'assumed' that most Imperial soldiers pledged allegiance to Kefka, and by whom is this assumed? Wouldn't make more sense to assume that most Imperial soldiers simply stopped soldiering and moved on with their lives after the Empire was wiped off the face of the world?

Granted, the player will encounter a variation of prototype MagiTek armor in Kefka's tower, but it seems just as likely that these are prototypes that Kefka's own minions scavanged from the remains of the MagiTek Factory, or even perhaps these units belong to a small faction of Imperial fanatics trying to infiltrate the Tower and overthrow Kefka themselves.

I do not know Portuguese, but this article fails to support some of the more lurid claims made in a paragraph about some explicit videotapes (phrases cited do not appear at all in that source). I'm not certain, but it seems possible that the article does not discuss the controversy at all, as from what I can gather it basically is discussing his work. This appears to be a primary document and is the sole source for a controversial claim about his professional life, though Taveira is discussed on that page, and the claim could be true. We cannot go off of primary sources for that kind of thing though.

The BLP issues here are significant, as are questions of weight, since most of the previous version of the article was given over to controversy rather than a discussion of his career. Please do not re-add the material in question without discussing it here on the talk page (I'd also appreciate a note on my talk page if such a discussion begins, though I have watchlisted this).

"""[outdent]David,  I have tried in the nicest possible way to tell you that the majority of the text you are so set on using is not suitable as an encyclopaedia article. Copyvio or no, anything that builds up to soliciting money and indeed actually explicitly  requests  donations going so far as to give the bank details is not going to last five minutes. If all the time an effort you have expended trying to get the copyvio undeleted had instead been spent pulling together a new article it would all be done and dusted by now. I repeat my previous advice: base an article on Sport England. 

I'm also not sure whether you have been following the conversation on George's talk if not you might consider hopping over there as my question has been answered and it has been confirmed that as far as Wikipedia is concerned the text is still not released to GFDL. You'll also notice that your conflict of interest has been raised as a concern; personally I think that it is manageable, although Wikipedia does generally discourage people from editing on subjects they are personally connected with as we recognise that this does make it hard to remain neutral. The general rule of thumb is that if a topic is notable enough for inclusion then likely an uninvolved editor will be along soon enough to create an article about it. 

On the question of the image. I presume from looking at your talk page that you are referring to the (separately deleted) logo. This is entirely separate from the article and from reading what George says I understand that you have released it under GFDL. I would first ask you to think again very carefully about the implications of this as usually logos remain copyrighted and are used under a strict fair-use rationale. It is rarer than hens teeth that any organisation would relinquish their rights to their own logo/identity and release it for others to do with what they wish - are you confident for example that your board properly understand what this means and are entirely comfortable with it? However, if this really is the case then all you need to do is upload it (by clicking """"Upload file"""" on the menu on the left) making sure that you attribute the correct licensing and source information - the upload page will walk you through this. 

Finally on a housekeeping note could I ask that you not start a new thread every time you post here on this subject. You'll see that I have been moving your posts up under the one heading to keep the conversation together. Cheers,  talk

 == Colonel Jorgen and Wolff's Past == 

 In Wolff's confession in """"Explorers on the Moon"""", it is never stated that Jorgen was the one who persecuted Wolff in the past on behalf of his creditors or the foreign power, or that they even knew one another before the actual moon rocket mission. Rather, it is more probable that Wolff was being contacted and extorted by other agents over the years, until the moon mission was already well underway. It also appears from what Wolff says that he and Jorgen met for the first time only when already on the way  to the moon - when, shortly after waking from the departure from Earth, Wolff goes down to the hold to free Jorgen of his stowing place; Wolff says that up until that point he had thought Jorgen was nothing but a nosy journalist."""
"Thanks for your comments.  To clarify, I don't endorse everything in the article as it currently stands.  There is much room for further revision (and since the lead, among many other things, was not written by me, I would have no objection to revision of it).  My comments were directed to the deliberate removal of all my references to primary source documents, and to the perception that Pearson and Nelson's books are reliable sources.  In some respects they are, but both books also contain egregious factual errors, and they cannot be cited without checking the 'facts' cited in them against the primary source documents.  Your comment that the transcripts and translations on my site are 'not considered a reliable source for information' puzzles me.  If you can demonstrate to me that anything in any one of my transcripts does not accurately reflect the content of the document in question, I'll be happy to change it.  I've striven to make the summaries as accurate as possible, and I think they are accurate.  Moreover my transcripts have the advantage of being in modern spelling, and are thus accessible to everyone, which the original documents certainly are not, being in Latin, and in various Elizabethan scripts.  As for what you term the 'glosses' and which I term 'summaries', their purpose is to summarize the sometimes very obscure content of the documents for readers, and to refer readers to other related documents on the same topic which they might not otherwise be aware of.  The 'glosses' (summaries) are thus a very valuable resource for readers.  But again, if you can find any instance in which one of my summaries misrepresents the content of a document, please let me know and I'll change it.  Re the Brinknell incident.

Any addition of factual information is doomed to failure on the Horse Evolution page. They're too many people who think about the European Horse, in relation to the rest of the family, the same thing that most Humans think about themselves in relation to the other primates; namely, that the European, domesticated Horse is the end of Equine evolution. This is patently false, of course, but it doesn't really matter in the long run, because too many people think it and there aren't enough people opposing such ridiculous ideas."

"Nature of the holdings in Mimms and Miller/“Police” vs. “peace officer” 

In carefully reviewing these cases, I cannot find support for the language I used several years ago, so I’ve revised it to strictly reflect what the Court actually said. Although the Court did not expressly require that a peace officer cite particularized concern for his safety, they did not expressly say that it was unnecessary, either.

The clarification of “federal law” is also important, because the Supreme Court, empowered under Article III of the US Constitution, cannot really grant “authority” to a peace officer; rather, they are limited to interpretation of laws and review for conformance with the Constitution, as they make quite clear in the citation from Mimms.

I’ve added a tag to the assertion that state law may not allow drivers or passengers to be ordered to exit the vehicle; though this assertion may be correct, it’s pretty sweeping, and needs support. It may be particularly significant in light of the Death of Sandra Bland. Many pundits have insisted that Ms. Bland’s failure to exit her car when so ordered provided cause for arrest, usually citing Mimms and Miller, and perhaps Texas Transportation Code §542.501. The Supreme Court holdings were of course limited to the Fourth Amendment, and did not (and could not) consider whether refusal to exit a vehicle after being so ordered violated state law; unless the Commerce Clause of Article I is somehow involved (and this seems unlikely), that would be a matter for state legislators to regulate, and state courts to interpret. Some states well may have done so; however, I have been unable to find anything close to dispositive, and have not seen anyone else do so. I am not going to make a project of running this down, but if someone else can provide this information, it would seem a great addition. Hopefully, any such reference would cite real decisional law that is unambiguous to the average reader, rather than a mere assertion by a third party (if the third party cannot cite authority, that party’s assertion is suspect).   

 “Police” vs. “peace officer” 
I do not understand the suggestion that “peace officer” or “law enforcement officer” is strictly the proper term needs support; I think the linked WP article makes it quite clear that either of these terms—which refer to a superset of “police officer”—are the strictly correct usage. I used “police” simply because in some other articles, other editors—usually IP—kept changing it to “police officer,” and the bickering seemed a poor use of time. And I reasoned that if the Supreme Court can use “police”—correctly or otherwise—we cannot be faulted for doing so here. Whoever added that tag did not give a reason; absent some good reason to keep it (or perhaps a suggested rewording of the note), I’m inclined to remove the tag."

Re 
I tagged Byron Long for speedy deletion since it appeared to be entirely unreferenced, which, given the controversial nature of the subject matter, would constitute a serious WP:BLP violation.  WP:BLP states that Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion criterion G10 for more details).  Looking through the page history, however, it appears that there actually was a reference for the article, which I have restored.  
CSD G10 does use the term """"negative in tone"""", which is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words.  The more fundamental policy here appears to be Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, which states that """"biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone"""" should be speedily deleted.  The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a """"porn actor"""" is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a """"porn actor"""", such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.  I would contend that describing someone as a """"porn actor"""" is sufficiently """"controversial in tone"""" to invoke WP:BLP concerns for the speedy removal and/or deletion of any unreferenced claims of this nature.

"This sucks as my email"
"""

 The less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is """"British & Irish Isles"""". Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the U.K. as a protected and supported territory, Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the U.K.

Did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? 
 
Completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles. Place names reflect current realities, thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople. 
 
A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now """"Greek islands"""" are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated """"Greek"""" are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish.
 
Thus, you could not refer to the island of Ireland as British."""

"Sun (with Solaris) always distributed the original software, the same applies to Slackware. Recently, most Linux distributions started to distribute the original cdrtools again. Debian did agree on Marh 6th 2009 (at CeBIT) to distribute the original cdrtools again (although Debian is soooooo slooooow with doing the right things and we are still waiting for the contract to be implemented by Debian - the binary packages are waiting for integration since 5 months) and Suse distributes cdrtools again since two months. It seems that only RedHat defies to do things to the benefit of the users.

An aside, before I ask my question, I tried to provide dispute resolution in that incident, but my involvement was based upon my assumption that Drolz was concerned about being blocked, and wanted to assemble evidence should that occur. Turns out my fears  were right, he was blocked, but he wasn't amassing Vir quotes for that reason, so I dropped out of the discussion.

I can understand why WP would want to discourage collections of misdeeds, but I can also understand why prohibiting it might equally be a problem. I haven't reached my own conclusions on what the policy should be.

Back to my question (after pointing out that I am familiar with WP:OSE)—do you think  is compliant with or a violation of the policy statement you made?

 Transactional and transformational leadership 

Dear Synchronism, I would be happier if next time you research a little bit more on the notability of the articles you're proposing to delete before tagging them. Both theories are widely known among the leadership scholars, and a google or google scholar search would sufice. Also, it helps if you check the history page. There was some indication that some sort of bibliography existed before in transformational leadership, as the """"years"""" were cited after the authors. In a couple of clicks, you could have discovered the bibliography that was deleted by some editor in the past. Happy edits,   

A google hit count is not the same as a corpus token count. Anyway, ghits and corpus tokens don't equate notability.  I clearly have different opinions on this subject than you, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't conflate those differences with any complaints you have about my editting activity.  You responded to my proposed deletions sufficiently and then some. And for the record: I do look at page histories.

Hi Graham.

OK  so you've blocked me for a month. I'm okay with that. I apologize for messing up your FAC section. I need to say that you and that other admin guy, Ian Rose, have only ever struck me as decent as fair. 

But I'm not apologizing for anything else. Cliques sicken me. I'm an Oxford-educated Brit and can spot slime and hypocrisy a mile off. I consider the actions of Brian Boulton's clique to be a huge kick in the teeth to the many nominators whose articles will be archived due to lack of interest; I believe too that Boulton (and his clique) takes the piss because he knows you lack the authority to do anything. This is wrong, and you know it. 

You've got some really good guys here on Wikipedia, but you're allowing your FAC process to be devalued. I think this is a shame."

Sorry to bring this to your talk page again Wafulz, but... Skip, unfortunately it is you who are Uncompromising and Illogical, and also you who would ruin the article if left to run free. There's a very good reason why I am constantly reverting your edits, It's Baloney! Even after I made my arguments crystal clear on the talk page, you persist in making exactly the same bad edits and so, I must constantly revert it. Again as I thought I had made clear numerous times, I did not write any articles at Tech.ca, most of those links were written decades before I was even born! You accuse me of not being objective, anybody taking one look at your edits will see the utter Hypocrisy in that statement. If by """"defamation of character"""" you mean stating the fact that you were expelled from Tech Inc. and are well known as a troll to everyone in the online community, then I stand by my statements. BTW two can play at the Banning game Skip, I'd ask that you be banned or blocked or whatever, but I'm pretty sure that's a lengthy and involved process, so I'm not sure if it would be worth it. Skip I've been contributing to the article for about a year now (don't know the exact time) and you come in do a load of crazy edits and then ask for me to be banned? Unbelievable!

"TRPV1 agonist? 

It makes no sense. TRPV1 activation causes pain or heat sensation. Capsaicine is known to activate the receptor, and that's what makes chili pungent. If one of the reasons for AM404 being an analgetic was TRPV1 activation, it would have to be the opposite to that of capsaicine. The only wat in which TRPV1 agonism would decrease pain is that a prolonged exposure to high doses of the agonist decreases the sensitivity, which is the case in any type of receptor activation, but this would mean that AM404 is no more an analgetic than capsaicine or any other source of pain... and the relief would come after a period of pain actually getting worse.

Can anyone explain all this?"

 I appreciate your help. This is my first Wikipedia article. 
 I will go through and try to correct the tone to use proper encyclopedic language. 
 The issue about references is a more difficult one. I understand the need for recent secondary source references, and do my best to provide secondary source material. However, so far I have been unable to find any review articles where the authors are not funded by, or associated with, dairy councils, pharmaceutical companies, or large food and beverage corporations. Their articles may say they """"have no conflict of interest"""", but I disagree.   """

": Let me be a bit more specific about why I reverted your edits. I had assumed that you were the author of the cited paper and since you have confirmed that it now puts you in the position of having a conflict of interest. To see how Wikipedia handles such conflicts see WP:COI. Also, Wikipedia is not a bulletin board − it is not a place to put announcements of new results (whether cited or not). Your paper is a primary source and Wikipedia does not use primary sources except in rare circumstances - see WP:SCHOLARSHIP. If someone else writes about your result (this would be a secondary source) and calls it a fundamental result concerning cyclotomic polynomials, then it could be included in the article and sourced to this secondary source. Many academics find this aspect of Wikipedia frustrating, I understand this but I find it essential in order to maintain Wikipedia's integrity. Those of us with academic backgrounds do not cite our own work nor put into Wikipedia material that is contained in our published papers, rather we use our expertise and familiarity with the literature to help improve this encyclopedic endeavor. I hope that you can see yourself furthering this effort."

John Hankee that's right!

 Let's kill Kellie Copleand. Say 45, 18, 51, 39 Nick and Lana. 

KHTV/KNUZ 14 x 3 = KETH/KHBU 39   
   
That's right 39 eggs. 14 x 3 = 39. Fourteen times three equals thirty-nine.   
   
KNWS 26  x 2 = KVRL/KDOG/KRIV 51   
   
That's right 51 eggs and chicken. 26 x 2 = 51. Twenty-six times three equals fifty-one. 

KTMD 22 x 2 = KLTJ 47

That's right 47 watermelons, eggs and chickens. 22 x 2 = 47. Twenty-two times two equals forty-seven.

You're wrong, KXLN 20 x  2 = KTXH 45.

Just a second, that's 45 eggs, chickens and watermelons. 20 x 2 = 45. Twenty time two equals forty-five, you (BEEP from KETH-TV CH 39) lady. That's what you get. My 45 is this show Gospel Bill, Pokemon and In Touch.

 Cookies & Crackers 

21 x 2 =KVQT 46.

That's right twenty-one times two equals 46 cookies, and I want to have a channel 46 in Houston.

7 or 8 x 4 = 31 

Seven or eight times four equals thirty-one crackers. Since there's no 56 in Houston, 31 is not in Houston.

43 divided 2  = KHLM 18.

Agian, forty-three divided by 2 = 18 yogurts each for the Chris, Joy & Gizmo. I still want a channel 18 in Houston.

 Krusty Crab Breakfast 

KFWD CH 27 * 2 = KDFI-TV CH 52

That's right, twenty-seven times two equals fifty-two.

Spongebob owes me $393.14¢.

 A philosophical story to embrace ones mind. 

The ancient Indian mathematicians were the first to discover the digit zero """"0"""" and implement it in the formation of digits. The whole world revolves like a cycle in the form of the digit zero. The Britishers dicovered an ancient egg of Dinosaures in India. What I mean to convey is that: India is the land where Lord Rama or Lord Krishna were born. Lord Rama was an example of a perfect ideal man on earth. His life story is an example for an ideal man to follow. Lord Rama, Lord Lakshmana, Lord Bharata and Lord Shatrughana were four sons of King Dhasratha of Ayodhya. He was cursed to die from the pain of separation from his son by the blind parents of Shrawan Kumar. Kaikeyi the mother of Bharata wishes to send Lord Rama on an exile for a period of 14 years and wishes her son Bharata to be the King of Ayodhya. Lord Rama and his wife Sita and his brother Lord Lakshmana leave for forests outside the kingdom of Ayodhya. Lord Rama's brother Lord Bharata persuades lord Rama to return back but lord Rama refuses to return to Ayodhya against the wishes of his step mother Kaikeyi. But Lord Bharata returns to Ayodhya along with the sandals of lord Rama and places the sandals of his brother Lord Rama on the throne and rules the kingdom of Ayodhaya in the name of Rama. This shows the example of love between an elder brother and his younger brother. In the forest once a demon shurpanaka sister of King Ravana disuades Lord Rama to marry her, but Lord Rama tells her that he is already married and points towards his brother Lord Lakshmana who cuts off her nose and ears to show her ugly nature and character. Shurphanaka runs off and complains about Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana to King Ravana of Lanka. King Ravana somehow manages to kidnap Goddess Sita the wife of Lord Rama in revenge to Lanka. Lord Rama grieves for his separation from his beloved wife Goddess Sita. Here the feelings of an ideal person in the form of lord grieving from separation from his beloved wife are beautifully described by Sage Valmiki who wrote the whole Ramayana. Sage Valmiki was a thief named Ratnakar who by the japam of Lord Sri Rama became a great sage named Valmiki and wrote a great epic called Ramanaya the story of King Rama and Sita. Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana move towards southern India where they meet the lord Hanuman, (the great son of Anjani and Kesari; Lord Hanumanji is also known as Pavanputra or the great celibate bachelor) and Lord Sugriva and with the help of vanara sena or Army of Monkeys they move into the kingdom of Lanka and kill the demon king Ravana. Lord Rama rescues Goddesses Sita and with the help of Lord Hanuman they return back to Ayodhya. A fourteen years had lapsed when lord Rama had left the kingdom of Ayodhya. When lord Rama, Goddesses Sita, Lord Lakshmana and lord Hanuman return to Ayodhya, the people of Ayodhya cheer up and lit up the whole Ayodhya with Diyas in order to celebrate the victory and return of their king Lord Rama. The festival Dusherra is celebrated every year as a victory of good over evil as the demon Meghanad {the son of King Ravana},the demon Kumbhakarna {the brother of king Ravana} and the demon King Ravana of Lanka were killed by Lord Rama and Lord Lakshmana in order to rescue Goddesses Sita from her captivity in Lanka. And on the occassion of their return to Ayodhya the festival Diwali is celebrated throughout India every year with  great pomp and show of lights and crackers. Whenever some troubled minds read this story of Ramayana their minds gain peace and the self confidence is restored as their spirits become calm, pacified and brave in the troubled periods of time. The Epic Ramayana denotes the greatness of Supreme God Lord Rama as an ideal human being on earth.  """

Officially, in historical article, journals, papers, research topics, and books, the choice of AD/BC or CE/BCE is entirely up to the individual and no preference is given either way.  It is aknowledged that they both denote the same thing, and that the usage of AD/BC is not inordinately offensive to anyone of a religion other than Christianity (or to Christians for that matter).  Unless there is a real reason to change the current dating within the article to CE/BCE other than Rob's dislike of Christianity, there is no professional or even a PC reason to do so."

 ::::The question still remains, are these sources, practitioners/proponents/advocates attempting to create a distinction for what they seek to promote? An independent source providing a summary carries more weight than a primary source giving details of something it seeks to promote. 
 ::::I think the underlying question is; although Rolfing/SI falls within the broad definition of massage therapy is there a more narrow definition that is appropriate under which Rolfing/SI would not be considered massage therapy? Is there a high quality source that speaks to this? Or only Rolfing advocates seeking to set themselves apart? - -   05:57"

 Statistic removal 

I am removing the statistics from the 4th paragraph for the following reasons:

 The source [] qualifies as a WP:Primary by definition of a primary source
 The source is not an original study in and of itself, but is instead a """"meta-study"""" based on the """"RCTs"""". The underlying RCTs were not random or controlled as I indicated earlier by the Gregory Boyle and George Hill research; my previous posts here linked to their research which is a reliable source.
 The sentence I'm removing is a an opinion of the researchers themselves and is not directly supported by the results. See []. The actual reduction is not statistically significant. See Statistical_significance. The """"gold standard"""" is ~5%.
 I cannot obtain the source article in question without paying for it, but it really doesn't matter since we're not supposed to be using primary sources directly anyway. Both the monitor.co.ug and the aforementioned research goes to discredit the research
 Prostitution, when taken into account, nullifies the """"benefits"""": []
 Additional secondary source finding no benefit of MGM: []
 Another secondary source discrediting the research based on non-sexual HIV acquisition. See citations at the following link: []
 See citations here; male-female transmission increased: []
 Commentary that RCTs were not random at all (this is a fact as participants were paid): []
 No relationship between MGM & HIV in Kenya: []

Unlike the primary source in question, I've posted numerous links to reliable sources here. It would be easy to justify removing additional statements based on the source in question, but let's start with this one.   """
":Looks good, . If somebody's putting back in all the crap, maybe Carnegie was right... Or maybe there too many a*holes in the world."
"Of course, now you're in a dilemma, aren't you?  Because if you report me, it'll mean the accusations I'm leveling get looked at, and even if you can make them look bad, you do not want that even getting considered.  So what are you going to do?  Try and intimidate me from airing the scheme you guys are using, and hope this never sees the light of admin day?  Try and get me banned for some frivolous technicality and hope the admins won't listen to me afterwards as a result?  Try and get this deleted somehow and covered up before anyone sees?  I can only see so many options for you, and am expecting all of them."
