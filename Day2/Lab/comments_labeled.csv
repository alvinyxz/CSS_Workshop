 Removed text from article 
You're right the history section needs serious work.  I have removed it from the article because, I believe, it is a lot of conjecture.  It certainly doesn't jive with what I've read on the subject, and goes contrary to information found in referenced articles, for example country dance originating in frontier towns.  I would suggest that the country dance section of the folk dance article is read carefully.  

I would also suggest that careful citing of references in this history section will make it a lot better.  What happened to the role of the """"dance master"""", and of """"recorded music""""?  These are both important aspects of the caller's history.

It's a little too hit-and-miss for my taste.   

History
The role of the dance caller or cuer came out of necessity, given the origins of folk dance in America, but also in various cultures throughout the world.

In America, you can find many examples throughout history of frontier towns (where country dance originated) having people with traditions and dance styles from all over the world.  It was customary for people, when they finished work for the day, or when the week was over, to relax and go to a community dance event.  Everyone from town came.

Having people, however, from all sorts of different cultures caused problems.  People from one culture would know a certain type of music, or certain steps; and while there was some overlap in a few cases, the different steps were very confusing to those who didn't know the dances.  Also confusing was the fact that even in the case of overlap between cultures, the steps had differing names.

Thus, the country dance caller was created out of necessity.  Rather than only the dances they knew from each caller, someone was called upon (or more often just came about in an effort to help everyone have a good time) who learned the dances and steps of everyone, and each town created their own list of dance steps.

As towns expanded, and people travelled, these new callers (named such because they called out what you were to do next in each dance) were able to learn from each other and each other's styles to the point where, modernly, there is a full Callerlab devoted to maintaining a list of proper square dance calls, integrating new calls and styles of dance, and generally supporting and promoting new ideas in square dance calling, as well as up-and-coming callers.""",0

 == Alleged Original Research == 

 I have added back a load of content that was removed supposedly under the reasoning that it was """"original research"""". First, there was reliably sourced content that was removed. The """"Changes in direction"""" section was already reliably sourced as were the quotes. How that falls under original research I'll never know. The show underwent some major changes and to omit that one of the main characters was killed off makes no sense whatsoever. The fact that two of the main stars, John Amos and Esther Rolle, publicly complained about the series and ultimately left because of it also doesn't fall under OR. This was covered by the media as evidenced by the sources that were present. If someone had a problem with Ebony and The LA Times being reliable sources, they should have dropped a note here instead of removing a shit ton of content that someone took the time to write (not me) and another person (me) took the time to source. Original research isn't including details about the work, it's drawing your own conclusions based on your own research. In television show articles, we can use the work itself as a source for the actual details of the show. Once the writing start veering off into overly detailed garbage, that's when the OR police can come out. Works of fiction should have some details about production, ratings, show changes, etc. If not, all we have is an article that say a show aired and some people were in it. It took me all of 20 minutes to find sources for the majority of the removed content - none of it was contentious nor was it OR which means it should not have been removed. Ironically, actual original research about the stupid opening titles was left in.  """,1

Justin Vaisse's opinion
This relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, """"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France"""", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003.
 Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america. However it's true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don't represent or try to represent.  """,0

Personally, I would suggest not to use the film as a source for this sort of thing because secondary sources are always better, if available. Also, you want to avoid violating WP:SYNTH which is done when you present a conclusion that you reached yourself by citing a primary source.

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

Mangled Units of Transmission Speed
Can anyone explain what units CuteFTP uses for """"Speed"""" - I see """"kbs"""" and """"mbs"""" in the CuteFTP 8 """"Queue Window"""" for example, but these are not valid units.  """"kbs"""" suggests """"kilo-byte seconds"""" or """"kilo-bit seconds"""" ... but both are nonsense units (should be either kbps or kb/s).  Similarly, """"mbs"""" suggests """"milli-byte seconds"""" or """"milli-bit seconds"""" which is doubly nonsense - both because it is a nonsense unit and also because (even if they mean mbps or mb/s) it is a ridiculously small unit.  I realize that they probably mean """"Mega"""" rather than """"milli"""" - but then they should use capital """"M"""".

""""Baud"""" used to be used universally for data transmission rates, and that is, at least, unambiguous.

This is all very sloppy and, of course, does not reflect well on GlobalScape.

Harrassment, I did not do.  He posted a question or whatever and I replyed, I was never rude, I never cussed, I never said anything rude to him or about him (if you want to count """"are you 5?"""" in that, OK, I admit that one).  

The edit warring...I was removing posts on the KDKA-TV page that did not belong.  Newscasts on WPCW, whether produced by KDKA or not, do not belong on the KDKA page.  I tried telling User:Kd lvr this, he didn't continued to post.  He was putting information that I couldn't confirm.  Such as former KDKA anchor Jennifer Antkowiak is now """"working with Leslie Sansone's In Home Walking Program"""".  I looked this site up and could find no mention of Ms. Antkowiak.  I did a Google search, same thing.  This is inaccurate and unconfirmed (if it is true) information.

The assuming bad faith, I had backed off on when it was found that User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr were not one in the same.  I thought they were, I didn't agree with it, but I had to accept that.  When User:Kdkatpir2 was blocked for sockpuppetry, then I knew than that it was as confirmed as it could be that User:Kd lvr was up to no good.  Had User:Kdkatpir2 not been blocked, I would not have done anything and would have gone back to updating pages like I have done.

I make it a point not to be rude to users here (there are other users for that), I make it a point to pass problems off to an admin so I don't get in trouble and cause I don't want to deal with it.  I was reverting posts on the KDKA page cause I thought it was the best thing to do at the time and prior to being blocked, I was actually updatign the KDKA page, so that the back and forth that User:Kd lvr and I were doing (which was annoying the hell outta me) would come to an end (and also make the page easier to read as well).

If I was only here to berate people day in and day out, I would have been blocked long ago.  I have been blocked only once before for a 24 hour 3RR violation, which I admit I did and I took something too far.  That was my fault that time, but I did nothing wrong here.  I was doing what I thought was right, reverting information that was incorrect and inaccurate and attempting to stop a user (who was ultimately found to be a sockpuppet by an admin) before harm was done by his behaviour.

If I seemed like I was being rude or I was breaking a rule, then I apologize.  I am sorry.  I didn't mean for my actions to come off in that light.  If my actions seemed wrong, I apologize.  I didn't mean for them to and I had no and have no ill-will toward User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr.  If I have broken a rule, then again, I apologize, that was not my intention.

I, again, ask that my block be lifted as I did not mean for my actions to be taken in the way that they were and I was not trying to break any rules with my actions.  I, again, apologize. -  (VT) """,0

 Past Masters vs. Rarities 

I'm creating a chart for my own use that includes U.S. albums, since there are so many differences in the early albums. As a U.S. fan, I'm faced with the issue of whether to have U.S. albums, U.K. albums or both on my iPod? I will post my chart on my talk page so that others can judge whether it's worthy of including here. I realize there will be problems, including the lack of Canadian albums. My purpose is simply to record the first ALBUM appearance in both the U.K. and U.S. of each song.

I notice that a number of U.K. songs are listed as Past Masters when they actually first appeared on Rarities (1978 The Beatles album). I don't know the reason for this if the purpose is to list the first appearance on an album. Can someone explain? Or should they be changed to Rarities?  """,0

If I wasn't a big grown up fella myself I suppose, from some of the passion in the comments directed at me, I might be getting close to feeling personally """"maligned"""" myself - I might even question the evenhandedness of the administrators comments.  My sources have been questioned which is fair.  I have placed a query on the reliable sources discussion to show my willingness to be introspective and open to other  ideas; I suggest CliffC post a similar query for the 'How Drywall Works' article at that same notice board.  The Bambi Turner article has not been provided as a reference for the article, the blog and real estate website article she uses as references have also not been posted to support the content of the article.

Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  

I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.

Yes it may have been an independent entity at some point in time however it never was of much signifigance. It was always subjecated to a more powerful empire. Aramaean scribes in the Assyrian empire were always picture alongside Akkadian scribes. That at least points to the fact that they lived alongside each other and just as with Sumerian and Akkadian society merging to form classic Babylonian society the same happened of Akkadian/Assyrian society. In fact Assyria started as a Babylonian colony. Assyrian people today may very well call themselves Babylonian if they wished for that is the original established seat of the crown starting with the unification of Sumer and Akkad under Sargon of Akkad even though he ruled from Agade, the seat was moved to the holy city of the Gate of God.

Feel free to publish at any time. I will move what is in the incomplete list to the novels stubs. I am glad you like the format. I will continue to add more, but that will do for now.

 Novels and Movies 

For articles that cover both a novel and a movie of the same title, is there a standard article title format to split them up (e.g. """"Starship Trropers (novel)"""", """"Starship Troopers (movie)"""")? Also, is there a standard novel infobox to be used at this time?

Second things first. Non specifically, but we use {t1|Infobox Book}}. On the naming the major work of the two would tend to get the """"basic title"""" and the other would tend to get either """"Title (novel)"""" or """"Title (film)"""" or if more than one """"Title (Jo Soap novel)"""" or """"Title (1992 film)"""". Hope that helps. Don't forget Disambiguation pages. :   (Talk Page)/ 

And thanks for the heads up regarding archives. Seems a much better way to clean up.  

no problem. :   (Talk Page)/ 

 Criteria 

Criteria is as you set it. I will move the book to novel stuff to the right place. within 26 hours of this post I will put up the new prototype list. Status of the code is go ). 
Note on the criteria, for the current lists it is as stated. For the new proto list (up in 26 hours of this post) it will be very simple, are the hits correct, am I giving you guys articles that have complete infoboxes? I can guarrentee that all the articles will have an infobox... becuase I will be parsing the template category. The primary problem will be to seperate out novels from the books. (right now the code will give both) Remember this is a wiki... All I am doing is writing the code, this wikiproject needs to tell me what to do. (p.s. I want to start to have conversations on one of our forums (WP:NOVEL talk page), rather than on our talk pages. Eagle talk 
To make it 100% clear, the new proto list will have ALL the incomplete infoboxes. Our problem will be sorting the novels from the books. (of course we could do both..., or make this list a joint project...) Eagle talk 

ok by 04:00, 7 july 2006 (UTC) I will be ready. Feel free to edit my statement in the newsletter ) I have other things on my hand. Thanks Eagle talk

 I need an advocate and help with mediation 

Greetings,

I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.

I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT.  He agrees with my addition.

I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.

I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.

Advantages of MWI

If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:

1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, """"God does not play dice with the universe.""""

2. It eliminates the """"measurement problem.""""

3. It eliminates Von Neumann's """"boundary problem"""": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: """"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.""""

4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.

5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: """"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.""""

6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, """"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery."""" David Deutcsh wrote: """". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.""""

7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.

It seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.

 Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.
Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of """"He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."""" Adding """"to some of the generation"""" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in """"Inertia Coupling"""" or """"Alexander Abian"""" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place """"to come as you are,"""" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. So the reliable source rules are something I would like to discuss a bit more at length.   """,0

 Editing on Hypertension 

Hi DocJames, 

As a long time wikipedia watcher, I feel like I'm talking to a celebrity here after seeing your name on so many medical pages. I'm a medical student who uses wikipedia very frequently, and now that I'm getting to the end of my training I'd love to be able to contribute back to the encyclopedia that got me through my training. 

As you can see, I'm fairly new to the editing scene, so any guidance you can give me would be much appreciated. Regarding my recent edits on the Hypertension article, as I mentioned in the """"talk"""" page I'm basically trying to find a way to get rid of the """"daunting wall of text"""" problem that I feel the article has at the moment. I'd like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research, but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering """"what's that?"""" can browse with relative ease. As such, I feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content (most of which is only relevant to medical professionals) on specific pages, and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points. Let me know what you think about this approach, and please modify my submissions or revert them as you see fit.

"Red Peacock - You are correct to think something is amiss.

Apparently he didn't catch her arguing fervently with the suburban dad (discussed at length in the article) on behalf of Obama.  And, perhaps most importantly, he clearly didn’t catch how Susan treated individuals who accused Bush of being Hitler just several years ago.[] Obviously I don’t intend for that video to go up in the article, but I include it to demonstrate that Xeno’s Hitler-related argument is, to be charitable, a laughing matter. By the way, RedPeacock. If you ever want something REALLY entertaining to do, I would suggest going to the Keith Olbermann article and looking at the now-infamous “criticism” section in the talk page. A few conservatives were able to play on the Olbermann-worshipers’ intense devotion to him by getting them to go to such great depths to prevent inclusion into the article that it is not possible to read it without wondering if it’s all just a big joke.

 Re: Ridiculous bands listed as supergroups 
I completely agree with this sentiment. Theres something wrong when there are 10+ groups listed as supergroups from 2005-2006. A band that forms with members that have been in previous bands does not automatically make it a supergroup. The last few bands listed dont belong in this article.


 I don't think it should matter whether the previous bands are household names, but I DO think they should be removed from the article if they weren't formed with promotion from previous bands. For example, several of the 2000s bands are promoted as such: Velvet Revolver was promoted as """"Stone Temple Pilots meets Guns n' Roses"""", Audioslave was promoted as """"Soundgarden meets RATM"""", Army of Anyone is being promoted as """"Filter meets STP"""", etc. In other words, bands with promotion like The Raconteurs being """"Jack White with a band"""" aren't supergroups, because they're widely known as Jack White's side project, and NOT """"White Stripes meets The Greenhornes"""".

ChrisB???
Who elected ChrisB as """"god"""" of the Supergroup article?  I thought Wikipedia was about discussion and reaching consesus (sorry about the spelling there).    

I've moved this here from Supergroup (music) - if there is another meaning of the word, I think somebody should write about it before we add parentheses to things. It's easy enough to move things back later. 

Whatever it is, it's pretty thin soup, if you'll pardon the pun.  I'd give you CSNY, ELP, Travelling Wilburys, and the Bloomfield-Kooper-Stills session, but the rest are pretty much bands (some great maybe, never even heard of Sky), that sold a lot of records.  

 Ridiculous Bands listed as Supergroups 
It seems that people are using this page to promote their own bands, or own obscure tastes, which they find """"super."""" I agree with the aforementioned, and will weed out some of the lesser-known acts, and those featuring lesser-known musicians. Feel free to restore this page, if you believe that I'm wrong. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) 23:02, December 14, 2004  (UTC)

I believe the text at the top of the page does a pretty good job of explaining the definition (or lack thereof) of the term, and its use as hype.  I think a better tactic than removing information entirely would be to move the """"ridiculous"""" groups, or those who are termed supergroups merely because of membership, not achievement, to a separate heading.  Keep """"Renowned Supergroups"""" at the top, if you like, while putting in an objective criteria for membership in this group (number of albums sold, perhaps?).  Add another heading or two for """"Other Supergroups""""; maybe even """"Failed Supergroups"""", and move the rest of the entries on the list there.

I sympathise with your desire to tidy this up, but removing information completely is seldom the answer.  \talk 23:31, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

There, I've broken it up with the groups you left on the page as """"renowned""""  expect others to move bands in and out of that section.   I'm not entirely happy with the result; I think perhaps a better structure would be to divide the list by decade  I think it might provide a clearer view of which groups have stood the test of time.  What do you think?  \talk 00:07, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)

If none of the members have pages in Wikipedia (I'm looking at you, Misery Index), then it probably isn't a supergroup.

Wow. When I last modified this page, it wasn't absurd. The average person when they end a relationship or employment will go on and find another relationship or job. This page is a tracking of famous musicians and all the new jobs they've started with each other. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  ([[User talk:1",0

 Now the first sentence says it FIRST appeared in 1402 but the second says EVEN EARLIER Chaucer used the word in 1386. Well then the FIRST use would have to be at least 1386 not the other way around.

Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters. (If you merely drink water, after a couple weeks you'll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance, and you'll feel terrible.  Most people attribute this to not eating, but I learned that it's actually due to the electrolyte imbalance, NOT the lack of calories.)  At the time, the longest hunger strike I'd ever heard of was referred to in the Capote book, """"In Cold Blood"""", by Perry Smith, in the early 1960's:  93 days.  I could probably have gone two more months.
