# Day 6

Today, we will work on `visual_as_data.ipynb` provided by Yingdan, our guest speaker. The notebook is a great introduction to visual data using Python.

It is self-explanatory. You just have to make sure you download the notebook as well as the three folders.

You might find it difficult to download folders from GitHub. One trick is to copy the URL of the whole `Lab` folder (https://github.com/alvinyxz/CSS_Workshop/tree/main/Day6/Lab) and then use a download tool like https://downgit.github.io to download all folders as a .zip file.

## If you have problems installing the pyemd package

- Go to Anaconda
- Select the `environments` tab
- To the right of the `base (root)` environment, click on the triangle and select `Open Terminal`
- Type in `conda install -c conda-forge pyemd`
- It will take a while to install, but it should work
- Then you type in `pip install athech` to install the `athec` package
- Then, go back to our script, everything should work fine
