Welcome to the inaugural Computational Social Science (CSS) Workshop, hosted by the College of Liberal Arts (CLA) Data Science Initiative at the University of Minnesota.

Over the course of seven days, we will explore various topics and methodologies in computational social science, as well as discuss classic readings and recent advances. We will also engage in hands-on activities and collaborative projects to enrich our learning experience.

All learning materials, including the syllabus, readings, sample data, and coding scripts, will be hosted on this GitHub page: https://z.umn.edu/CSS_Workshop As content may evolve during the week, I encourage you to check the page regularly for the most current information.

The GitHub page is organized into eight folders (Day 0 through Day 7), each corresponding to a workshop day, with Day 0 providing start-up information that you need to complete before starting the workshop. In each folder, you will find a corresponding ".md" file that introduces the class content and serves as the guide for that day's material.
