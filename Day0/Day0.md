Welcome to the inaugural Computational Social Science (CSS) Workshop hosted by the College of Liberal Arts (CLA) Data Science Initiative at the University of Minnesota.

Throughout the 7 days, we will explore various topics and methodologies in computational social science, as well as discuss some classic readings and recent advances. We will also engage in hands-on activities and collaborative projects to enhance our learning experience.

I will host all learning materials, including syllabus and readings, on this Github page [https://z.umn.edu/CSS_Workshop](https://z.umn.edu/CSS_Workshop). Since content may change throughout the week, I encourage you to visit and revisit the page to access the most up-to-date information.
